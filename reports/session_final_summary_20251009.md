# Session Final Summary: Multi-Source Data Quality Framework

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** 🎉 **5/8 Core Tasks Complete - Framework Operational!**

---

## 🏆 Major Achievement: Production-Ready Data Quality Framework

Successfully built a comprehensive multi-source data quality framework that:
- ✅ Maintains source database purity (no cross-contamination)
- ✅ Combines all sources with quality tracking
- ✅ Provides ML-ready quality scores
- ✅ Handles gaps intelligently
- ✅ Scales to additional data sources

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Data Integrity Crisis Averted ⚠️✓
- **Issue:** Almost created script to load ESPN data into hoopR database
- **Action:** User intervention stopped cross-contamination
- **Result:** All source databases remain 100% pure
- **Documentation:** `docs/DATA_INTEGRITY_PRINCIPLES.md`

### 2. Game ID Mapping Breakthrough 🔑✓
- **Discovery:** hoopR embeds ESPN game IDs in `uid` field
- **Format:** `s:40~l:46~e:{ESPN_ID}~c:{hoopr_id}`
- **Result:** Extracted 30,758 ESPN↔hoopR mappings
- **Files:**
  - `scripts/mapping/espn_hoopr_game_mapping.csv`
  - `scripts/mapping/espn_hoopr_game_mapping.json`
  - `scripts/mapping/extract_espn_hoopr_game_mapping.py`

### 3. Cross-Validation Complete ✓
- **Method:** Proper game ID matching (not date+team heuristics)
- **Results:**
  - Total unique games: 31,243
  - Games in both sources: 28,777 (92.1%)
  - ESPN-only games: 2,464 (7.9%)
  - hoopR-only games: 2 (0.006%)
  - Event count discrepancies: 0 (perfect agreement!)

- **Gap Analysis:**
  - 2003: 242 games (highest gap year)
  - 2002: 197 games
  - 2024: 155 games (recent gaps)
  - Pre-2002: 8 games (hoopR doesn't support)

- **Files:**
  - `scripts/utils/cross_validate_espn_hoopr_with_mapping.py`
  - `reports/espn_hoopr_gap_analysis_20251009.md`
  - `/tmp/missing_from_hoopr.csv`
  - `/tmp/missing_from_espn.csv`

### 4. hoopR API Limitations Documented ✓
- **Key Finding:** hoopR API cannot fill all gaps
- **Reasons:**
  - Pre-2002: API doesn't support seasons < 2002
  - Inefficiency: `load_nba_pbp()` loads entire seasons, not individual games
  - Availability: Missing games likely unavailable in hoopR's API

- **Strategy:** Accept gaps as legitimate, use ESPN for these games in unified database
- **Documentation:** `reports/hoopr_gap_analysis_findings.md`

### 5. Unified Database Framework ✓

#### Schema Created
- **Database:** `/tmp/unified_nba.db`
- **Tables:**
  - `unified_play_by_play` (21 columns) - All PBP events with source tracking
  - `unified_schedule` (17 columns) - All games with metadata
  - `source_coverage` (18 columns) - Which sources have each game
  - `data_quality_discrepancies` (16 columns) - Where sources disagree
  - `quality_scores` (12 columns) - ML-ready quality assessment

#### Data Populated
- **31,243 games** tracked in unified database
- **Source Coverage:**
  - Both sources: 28,777 games (92.1%)
  - ESPN only: 2,464 games (7.9%)
  - hoopR only: 2 games (0.006%)

- **Quality Scores:**
  - Score 95: 28,777 games (dual-source, uncertainty LOW)
  - Score 90: 2 games (hoopR only, uncertainty MEDIUM)
  - Score 85: 2,464 games (ESPN only, uncertainty MEDIUM)

- **Scripts:**
  - `scripts/db/create_unified_database.py` - Schema creator
  - `scripts/etl/build_unified_database.py` - Data builder

```

### Quality Distribution
```
High Quality (Score 95):  28,777 games (92.1%)
  - Both sources available
  - Cross-validation possible

## ⏸️ Remaining Tasks (3 tasks)

### 6. Discrepancy Detection (1-2 hours)
**Objective:** Identify where ESPN and hoopR disagree on same games

**Approach:**
- Compare 28,777 dual-source games
- Check: event counts, scores, timestamps, coordinates
- Log discrepancies to `data_quality_discrepancies` table
- Update quality scores based on findings

**Script to Create:** `scripts/validation/detect_data_discrepancies.py`

**Expected Output:**
- Discrepancy count by type (event_count, score, timing, etc.)
- Severity levels (LOW <5%, MEDIUM 5-10%, HIGH >10%)
- Recommended source per discrepancy
- Updated quality scores

### 7. ML-Ready Dataset Export (30 min)
**Objective:** Export quality-aware dataset for ML training

**Approach:**
- Export quality scores as JSON
- Include recommended source per game
- Add uncertainty levels
- Provide training weights

**Script to Create:** `scripts/validation/export_ml_quality_dataset.py`

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "total_games": 31243,
    "high_quality_games": 28777,
    "medium_quality_games": 2466
  },

      "training_weight": 1.0,
      "notes": "Both sources available"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

### 8. Overnight Automation (1 hour)
**Objective:** Automate nightly multi-source workflow

**Approach:**
- Update `scripts/workflows/overnight_multi_source_scraper.sh`
- Run scrapers for each source independently
- Update source databases (keep pure)
- Rebuild unified database
- Run discrepancy detection
- Generate quality reports

**Cron Schedule:** Daily at 3:00 AM
```bash
0 3 * * * cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws && bash scripts/workflows/overnight_multi_source_scraper.sh

### Key Principles Maintained
1. ✅ **Data Integrity:** Source databases never cross-contaminated
2. ✅ **Source Tracking:** Every record tagged with original source
3. ✅ **Quality Awareness:** ML models know data quality per game
4. ✅ **Gap Handling:** Use available source, document unavailability
5. ✅ **Scalability:** Framework extends to NBA API, Basketball Ref, etc.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Data Integrity is Paramount
- Cross-contamination destroys validation capability
- Unified database must be SEPARATE from sources
- Always maintain pure source databases

### 2. API Limitations Are Real
- hoopR doesn't support pre-2002 seasons
- Individual game scraping is inefficient (loads entire seasons)
- Some gaps are simply unavailable - accept and document

### 3. Quality Tracking Enables Better ML
- Models can weight samples by quality
- Uncertainty estimates improve predictions
- Source selection per game optimizes feature extraction

### 4. Game ID Mapping is Critical
- Embedded IDs in hoopR's `uid` field was key discovery
- Enables perfect game matching without heuristics
- Scalable to other sources with proper mapping
