## Unavailable Games Breakdown

### By Reason

| Reason | Count | % of Unavailable |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| No ESPN-hoopR game ID mapping | 2,025 | 82.2% |
| Pre-2002 (API limitation) | 62 | 2.5% |
| Not in hoopR API data (2002) | 226 | 9.2% |
| Not in hoopR API data (2024) | 58 | 2.4% |
| Not in hoopR API data (other seasons) | 93 | 3.8% |

### Analysis by Category

#### Category 1: No Game ID Mapping (2,025 games, 82.2%)

**Root Cause:** These games exist in ESPN but haven't been added to the ESPN-hoopR game ID mapping.

**Date Range:** Primarily 2024 season games (October-December 2024)

**Solution:**
- Update `scripts/mapping/extract_espn_hoopr_game_mapping.py` to include these games
- Re-run mapping extraction
- Many of these games likely exist in hoopR but aren't linked

**Impact:** Medium - mapping update could restore some coverage

#### Category 2: Pre-2002 Games (62 games, 2.5%)

**Root Cause:** hoopR API doesn't support seasons before 2002

**Date Range:** 2001-11-28 to 2002-02-06 (season 2001)

**Solution:** None - API limitation

**Impact:** Low - very old data, ESPN coverage likely sufficient

#### Category 3: Missing from hoopR API (377 games, 15.3%)

**Root Cause:** Games exist in ESPN and have mappings, but hoopR API returns no PBP data

**Seasons Affected:**
- 2002: 226 games (17.9% of season)
- 2024: 58 games (recent, incomplete)
- 2004-2017: 93 games (scattered)

**Solution:** None - hoopR data source doesn't have these games

**Impact:** Low - ESPN has this data

## Data Quality Implications

### Current Multi-Source Coverage

| Source Combination | Games | % | Quality Score | Use Case |
|-------------------|-------|---|---------------|----------|
| ESPN + hoopR (dual) | 28,777 | 92.1% | 95 | Primary dataset, cross-validation |
| ESPN only | 2,464 | 7.9% | 85 | Backup source, no validation |
| hoopR only | 2 | 0.006% | 90 | Edge cases |

### Recommendations

1. **Accept 92.1% as maximum hoopR coverage**
   - No further gap filling attempts needed
   - Focus on maintaining current data quality

2. **Use ESPN as sole source for 2,464 games**
   - Quality score: 85 (vs 95 for dual-source)
   - Document in unified database
   - No discrepancy detection possible

3. **Prioritize game ID mapping updates**
   - Potential to restore ~2,000 games to dual-source
   - Run `extract_espn_hoopr_game_mapping.py` with updated logic
   - Re-run gap analysis after mapping update

4. **Archive gap filler for future use**
   - Tool works correctly (filled 0 because none available)
   - Keep for potential future hoopR API updates
   - Document permanently unavailable games
