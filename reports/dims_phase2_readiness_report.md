- Working tree: Clean
- Branch: `main` (up to date with origin)

---

## Part B: Event Hooks & Phase 2 Prep (✅ COMPLETE)

### 1. Event Hook Verification

**Git Post-Commit Hook:**
- **Location:** `.git/hooks/post-commit`
- **Status:** ✅ **WORKING** (fixed `python` → `python3` issue)
- **Trigger:** Automatic on every commit
- **Actions:**
  - Runs `dims_cli.py verify --update`
  - Updates metrics in background
  - Logs to `inventory/logs/git_hook.log`

**Configuration Verified:**
```yaml
events:
  enabled: true
  hooks_dir: "inventory/events"
  cooldown_seconds: 60
  hooks:
    - git_post_commit      # ✅ Working
    - s3_upload_complete   # ⏸️ Not yet implemented
    - scraper_complete     # ⏸️ Hook exists, not integrated
    - monthly_audit        # ⏸️ Cron job (not yet scheduled)
    - daily_sync_check     # ⏸️ Cron job (not yet scheduled)
```

**Test Results:**
- Commit `25c05e2`: Hook triggered successfully
- Commit `7ef1ca4`: Hook triggered successfully
- Log confirms: DIMS verification running in background
- Metrics automatically updated after each commit

**Scraper Completion Hook:**
- **Location:** `scripts/utils/scraper_completion_hook.sh`
- **Status:** ⚠️ **EXISTS BUT NOT INTEGRATED**
- **Purpose:** Updates DATA_CATALOG.md, logs completion
- **Next Step:** Integrate with DIMS event system

### 2. Phase 2 Requirements Analysis

**From ADCE Master Index:**

**Phase 2 Goal:** Build the missing reconciliation engine

**What Phase 2 Needs to Do:**
1. **Scan S3** to inventory current data (what we HAVE)
2. **Compare** against expected coverage schemas (what we SHOULD have)
3. **Identify gaps** (what's MISSING):
   - Missing games
   - Missing files (PBP, box scores, etc.)
   - Stale data (>7 days old for recent games)
   - Incomplete data (have box scores but missing PBP)
4. **Prioritize gaps** (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
5. **Generate collection tasks** → `inventory/gaps.json`
6. **Update inventory** continuously

**Key Components to Build:**
1. **Enhanced Inventory System** - `inventory/data_inventory.yaml`
2. **Gap Detection Engine** - `scripts/reconciliation/detect_data_gaps.py`
3. **Coverage Analyzer** - Compares inventory vs. schemas
4. **Reconciliation Loop** - Continuous monitoring

**Expected Data Schema Structure:**
```yaml
# inventory/data_inventory.yaml (to be created)
expected_coverage:
  espn:
    seasons: [2016-17, 2017-18, ..., 2024-25]
    data_types:
      - play_by_play (required: true, freshness: 7 days)
      - box_scores (required: true, freshness: 7 days)
      - player_stats (required: false, freshness: 30 days)

  basketball_reference:
    seasons: [2000-01, ..., 2024-25]
    data_types:
      - advanced_stats (required: true, freshness: 30 days)
      - box_scores (required: false)

  nba_api:
    seasons: [2014-15, ..., 2024-25]
    data_types:
      - player_tracking (required: true, freshness: 14 days)
      - team_dashboards (required: true, freshness: 14 days)

  hoopr:
    seasons: [2016-17, ..., 2024-25]
    data_types:
      - parquet_files (required: true, freshness: 7 days)

current_inventory:
  # Auto-generated from S3 scans
  espn:
    play_by_play:
      total_games: 8230
      seasons: [...]
      last_updated: "2024-10-22"

gaps_detected:
  critical:  # Last 7 days
    - source: espn
      type: play_by_play
      games: [401579404, 401579405, ...]
      priority: CRITICAL
      reason: "Recent games missing (< 7 days old)"

  high:  # Missing recent season data
    - source: nba_api
      type: player_tracking
      season: 2024-25
      priority: HIGH
      reason: "Current season incomplete"

  medium:  # Older data gaps
    - source: basketball_reference
      type: advanced_stats
      season: 2022-23
      priority: MEDIUM
      reason: "Historical gap detected"
```

### 3. Current System Capabilities

**What We Already Have:**
- ✅ 75 scrapers unified in `scraper_config.yaml`
- ✅ AsyncBaseScraper framework
- ✅ S3 storage (172,726 objects, 118 GB)

- ✅ PostgreSQL backend for history
- ✅ Event-driven architecture (git hooks working)

   - Document what data we SHOULD have for each source
   - Specify required vs. optional data types
   - Define freshness requirements

2. **Build S3 Inventory Scanner**
   - Scan S3 bucket to list all current files
   - Parse file paths to extract metadata (source, season, game_id, type)
   - Generate structured inventory of what we HAVE

3. **Create Reconciliation Engine**
   - Compare HAVE vs. SHOULD
   - Identify missing games, stale data, incomplete datasets
   - Assign priorities (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

4. **Generate First Gap Report**
   - Run reconciliation manually
   - Review gaps detected
   - Validate priority assignments
   - Document findings

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
