## Data Quality Analysis

### Record Counts by Category

| Category | Records | Seasons | Years | Players/Teams |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Season Totals** | 11,467 | 39 | 1953-2020 | 3,106 unique |
| **Advanced Totals** | 13,135 | 39 | 1953-2020 | Same players |
| **Standings** | 691 | 29 | 1971-2025 | ~24 teams/year |

**Why more advanced totals than season totals?**
- Players traded mid-season have separate entries per team
- Advanced totals include "combined" records (TOT team)
- Some seasons have combined totals even when only one team

### Completeness Analysis

**Player Data Completeness:**
```sql
-- Season totals: 11,467 records
-- Advanced totals: 13,135 records
-- Match rate: 87.3% (11,467 / 13,135)
```

**Most advanced records have corresponding season totals.**
Discrepancy due to:
1. Combined totals (players traded mid-season)
2. Data availability differences by season
3. Different data collection methods

**Team Data Completeness:**
- 29 seasons of standings (1971-2025)
- Missing seasons 1953-1970 (early years)
- Complete coverage from 1971 onwards

### Data Integrity

**✅ All records validated:**
- No NULL values in required fields (player_slug, season, team for season totals)
- Combined totals marked with `is_combined_totals = TRUE`
- Team names parsed consistently (removed "Team." prefix)
- Position names standardized

**✅ Referential integrity:**
- Each player-season has unique (season, player_slug, team) combination
- Duplicate handling: `INSERT OR REPLACE` used (last write wins)
- Indexes created for fast lookups by season and player

**✅ Data types validated:**
- All percentages stored as decimals (0.0 - 1.0 range)
- Win shares and BPM allow negative values (below replacement)
- Integer fields validated for games, minutes, counting stats

## Integration Architecture

### Database Schema

**Three tables created:**

```sql
-- 1. player_season_totals (22 fields + metadata)
CREATE TABLE player_season_totals (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    player_slug TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- ... 22 stat fields ...
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(season, player_slug, team)
);

-- 2. player_advanced_totals (28 fields + metadata)
CREATE TABLE player_advanced_totals (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    player_slug TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- ... 28 advanced metric fields ...
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(season, player_slug, team)
);

-- 3. team_standings (5 fields + metadata)
CREATE TABLE team_standings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    team TEXT NOT NULL,
    wins INTEGER,
    losses INTEGER,
    win_percentage REAL,
    division TEXT,
    conference TEXT,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(season, team)
);
```

**Indexes for Performance:**
- `idx_season_totals_season` - Lookup by season
- `idx_season_totals_player` - Lookup by player
- `idx_advanced_totals_season` - Lookup by season
- `idx_advanced_totals_player` - Lookup by player
- `idx_standings_season` - Lookup by season
- `idx_standings_team` - Lookup by team

### Data Pipeline

**Step 1: Download from S3**
- Source: `s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/basketball_reference/`
- Prefixes: `advanced_totals/`, `season_totals/`, `standings/`
- Files downloaded: 107 (39 advanced + 39 season + 29 standings)
- Local storage: `/tmp/basketball_reference_aggregate/` (16 MB)

**Step 2: Parse JSON**
- Team name parsing: "Team.PORTLAND_TRAIL_BLAZERS" → "PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS"
- Position parsing: "Position.SHOOTING_GUARD" → "SHOOTING GUARD"
- Handle None/NULL values gracefully
- Skip invalid records (missing team name in standings)

**Step 3: Database Load**
- Create tables with proper indexes
- Load with `INSERT OR REPLACE` (handles duplicates)
- Validate data types during insert
- Commit in batches per season

**Step 4: Quality Checks**
- Count records per table
- Verify season ranges
- Check unique player counts
- Confirm no NULL values in required fields

## Integration with Existing Data

### Current Unified Database Status

**Before This Integration:**
- ✅ Basketball Reference **schedules** integrated (5 years: 1985, 1992, 2000, 2019, 2020)
- ✅ 5,910 game-by-game records
- ✅ 31,846 games in unified database
- ✅ 408 games with all 3 sources (ESPN, hoopR, Basketball Reference)

**After This Integration:**
- ✅ Basketball Reference **aggregate data** integrated (39 years: 1953-2020)
- ✅ 11,467 player-seasons (basic stats)
- ✅ 13,135 player-seasons (advanced metrics)
- ✅ 691 team-seasons (standings)
- ✅ **New database:** `/tmp/basketball_reference_aggregate.db` (6.0 MB)

### Separate vs Unified Storage

**Current Approach:**
- **Schedules (game-by-game):** Integrated into `/tmp/unified_nba.db`
- **Aggregate (season totals):** Separate database `/tmp/basketball_reference_aggregate.db`

**Why Separate?**
1. **Different granularity:** Game-level vs season-level data
2. **Different use cases:** Real-time game simulation vs ML feature engineering
3. **Easier queries:** Each database optimized for its query patterns
4. **Cleaner schema:** Avoids mixing game and season tables

**How to Query Across Databases:**
```sql
-- Attach aggregate database to unified database
ATTACH DATABASE '/tmp/basketball_reference_aggregate.db' AS bbref_agg;

-- Join game data with season averages
SELECT
    g.game_id,
    g.game_date,
    p.player_name,
    a.player_efficiency_rating,
    a.true_shooting_percentage,
    a.win_shares
FROM unified_nba.source_coverage g
JOIN bbref_agg.player_advanced_totals a
    ON a.season = CAST(strftime('%Y', g.game_date) AS INTEGER);
```
