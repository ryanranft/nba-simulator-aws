# Claude Progress Tracking Protocol

This file contains the complete protocol for how Claude tracks and updates progress in PROGRESS.md.

## CRITICAL - Progress Tracking Protocol

### 1. Always Read PROGRESS.md First

Understand what has been completed and what's next before starting any work.

### 2. Follow PROGRESS.md Sequentially

Start from the first "‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING" or "‚è≥ IN PROGRESS" task. Do not skip ahead unless explicitly instructed.

### 3. If the Plan Changes

Update PROGRESS.md BEFORE proceeding with new work:
- Document what changed and why
- Update task descriptions, time estimates, or dependencies
- Add new tasks or remove obsolete ones
- Mark changed sections with date and reason
- Get user confirmation before proceeding with the updated plan

### 4. Only Mark Tasks as "‚úÖ COMPLETE" When You Receive

- Terminal output showing successful execution (exit code 0, expected output), AND
- Either: User says "done", "complete", "looks good", or similar affirmation
- OR: User proceeds to ask about the next task (implicit confirmation)
- **Exception:** Minor tasks (<5 min) can be auto-marked if command succeeds with clear success output

### 5. Do NOT Assume Completion

Even if a command runs without errors, wait for user confirmation.

### 6. Update PROGRESS.md Immediately

After each completed step.

### 7. If Errors Occur

Document them in PROGRESS.md and work with user to resolve before proceeding.

### 8. Maintain the Same Format and Detail Level

When updating PROGRESS.md.

## Update PROGRESS.md When

- ‚úÖ Completing any phase or sub-phase
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Discovering blockers or missing prerequisites
- üìù Changing approach or architecture
- ‚ùå Encountering errors that delay timeline
- ‚úÖ User explicitly confirms task completion
- üí∞ Actual costs differ significantly from estimates

## Proactively Suggest Running Maintenance Tasks When

- **After completing a phase:** "Phase X.Y complete! Should I run `make sync-progress` to verify AWS resources match PROGRESS.md?"
- **After creating/modifying scripts:** "New scripts created. Should I run `make inventory` to update FILE_INVENTORY.md?"
- **After solving a new error:** "This error isn't in TROUBLESHOOTING.md yet. Should I add it? (Then run `make inventory`)"
- **After making architectural decisions:** "Should I create an ADR for this decision? (See docs/adr/template.md)"
- **After creating AWS resources:** "New AWS resources created. Should I run `make check-costs` to see the cost impact?"
- **Monday morning or start of week:** "It's a new week! Should I run `make update-docs` for weekly maintenance?"
- **After 5+ commits:** "Several commits made. Should I run `make backup` to create a backup?"

## Error Handling Protocol

- If a command fails, STOP and report to user immediately
- Do NOT attempt multiple fixes without user guidance
- Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for known solutions first
- If unknown error, log with `log_solution` after resolving
- Update PROGRESS.md with error details and resolution

## Context Awareness

- Check what phase we're in before suggesting commands
- Don't suggest Phase 3 commands if Phase 2 isn't complete
- Verify prerequisites exist before executing dependent tasks
- Use `python scripts/maintenance/sync_progress.py` if unsure of current state

## Your Workflow Should Be

1. Read PROGRESS.md to understand current state
2. **If user requests changes to the plan**: Update PROGRESS.md first, get confirmation, then proceed
3. Execute the next pending task
4. Wait for confirmation (terminal output or user saying "done")
5. Update PROGRESS.md to mark task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
6. Move to next task
