### 4. Player Tracking Scraper ⚠️

**Test**: Scraped player 76001 for 2024-25 season

**Results**:
- **MLflow Tracking**: ✅ Experiment created: `nba_api_player_tracking_scraper`
- **Metrics Tracked**:

## Book Recommendations Validation

### rec_22 (Panel Data Structure) ✅

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

All scrapers add panel data fields at collection time:
- Multi-index keys (entity_id, game_id, timestamp)
- Temporal fields (event_timestamp, scraped_at)
- Metadata fields (season, endpoint)

**Example** (from team_dashboards):
```json
{
  "team_id": 1610612737,
  "season": "2024-25",
  "endpoint": "general_splits",
  "game_date": "2025-10-17T17:48:41.667739",
  "scraped_at": "2025-10-17T17:48:41.667747"
}
```

---

### rec_11 (Feature Engineering Metadata) ✅

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

All scrapers include feature metadata in output:
```python
"features": {
    "generated": False,
    "version": "1.0"
}
```

Ready for unified feature extraction integration.

---

### ml_systems_1 (MLflow Tracking) ✅

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

All scrapers create MLflow experiments:
- ✅ `nba_api_team_dashboards_scraper`
- ✅ `nba_api_player_dashboards_scraper`
- ✅ `nba_api_game_advanced_scraper`
- ✅ `nba_api_player_tracking_scraper`

Tracking includes:
- Parameters (start_season, end_season, output_dir)
- Metrics (api_calls, success_rate, duration, records)
- Incremental logging at checkpoints

---

### ml_systems_2 (Quality Monitoring) ✅

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

All scrapers track 6 quality metrics:
1. api_calls (total API requests)
2. api_successes (successful responses)
3. api_failures (failed requests)
4. records_collected (total records)
5. entities_processed (players/teams/games)
6. empty_responses (empty but valid responses)

Comprehensive final reporting includes:
- Duration
- Success rate
- Record counts
- Failure tracking

---

## Performance Metrics

### API Rate Limiting

All scrapers properly implement 1.5s rate limiting:
- Team Dashboards: ~9s for 6 endpoints
- Player Dashboards: ~45s for 6 endpoints
- Game Advanced: ~5s for 3 endpoints (with 2 failures)

### Output Format

All scrapers save JSON with proper structure:
```json
{
  "entity_id": "...",
  "season": "2024-25",
  "scraped_at": "2025-10-17T...",
  "data": {
    "endpoint_name": [
      {
        "entity_id": "...",
        "game_id": "...",
        "event_timestamp": "...",
        "scraped_at": "...",
        "...": "..."
      }
    ]
  },
  "panel_structure": {
    "multi_index": ["entity_id", "game_id", "event_timestamp"],
    "temporal_features_ready": true
  },
  "features": {
    "generated": false,
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

## Known Issues (Pre-Existing)

### 1. Player Tracking Endpoints
**Issue**: Require team_id parameter in addition to player_id
**Impact**: 0% success rate in current test
**Fix**: Modify scraper to lookup team_id for each player
**Enhancement Status**: ✅ Working correctly (properly tracks failures)

### 2. Game Advanced - Similarity Endpoint
**Issue**: Wrong parameter (game_id) - endpoint expects different arguments
**Impact**: Endpoint fails but doesn't affect others
**Fix**: Research correct parameters for GLAlumBoxScoreSimilarityScore
**Enhancement Status**: ✅ Working correctly (properly tracks failures)

### 3. Game Advanced - Win Probability
**Issue**: API sometimes returns invalid JSON
**Impact**: Intermittent failures
**Fix**: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
**Enhancement Status**: ✅ Working correctly (properly tracks failures)

3. **Fix Game Advanced Endpoints** 🔧
   - Research correct parameters for similarity endpoint
   - Add retry logic for win_probability endpoint
   - Enhancements are already in place

### Next Steps

1. **Run Full Collection** (Phases 1 & 3)
   - Team Dashboards: 30 teams × 6 endpoints = ~180 API calls
   - Player Dashboards: ~500 active players × 6 endpoints = ~3,000 API calls
   - Estimated time: ~90 minutes total

2. **Load to Database**
   - Use enhanced `load_local_json_to_rds.py`
   - Data will have panel structure
   - Quality monitoring will track drift

3. **Validate MLflow Tracking**
   - Check experiments: `mlflow ui`
   - Verify metrics are logged
   - Review success rates

4. **Fix Remaining Scrapers** (Phases 2 & 4)
   - Player Tracking: Add team_id logic
   - Game Advanced: Fix endpoint parameters
