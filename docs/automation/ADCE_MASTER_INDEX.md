# Autonomous Data Collection Ecosystem (ADCE) - Master Index

**Status:** 🏗️ Design Complete, Implementation Pending
**Created:** October 22, 2025
**Vision:** Self-healing, autonomous NBA data collection that runs 24/7

---

## Overview

The **Autonomous Data Collection Ecosystem (ADCE)** is a comprehensive system that:
- ✅ Automatically migrates scrapers to unified framework
- ✅ Continuously monitors data inventory vs. expected coverage
- ✅ Detects gaps and generates collection tasks
- ✅ Orchestrates scrapers intelligently with global rate limiting
- ✅ Runs in self-healing recursive loop 24/7
- ✅ Requires ZERO manual intervention

**Key Insight:** Current systems (scrapers, inventory, gap detection) are separate. ADCE integrates them into one unified, autonomous ecosystem.

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Automated Scraper Migration ⭐ **IN DESIGN**
**Goal:** Migrate all 63 remaining scrapers to AsyncBaseScraper overnight

**Design Document:** `docs/automation/AUTOMATED_SCRAPER_MIGRATION_DESIGN.md`

**What it does:**
- Analyzes each scraper to detect pattern (async, incremental, specialized, agent, utility)
- Generates AsyncBaseScraper-compatible code
- Creates configuration entries
- Tests migration (dry run, rate limiting, config loading)
- Commits if successful
- Runs autonomously overnight (5-6 hours for 63 scrapers)

**Expected Results:**
- 📊 54-57 scrapers migrated automatically (85-90% success rate)
- 📝 6-9 scrapers flagged for manual review
- 📈 AsyncBaseScraper adoption: 23% → 100%
- ⏱️ 5.25 hours autonomous execution

**Status:** Design complete, ready for implementation

---

### Phase 2: Data Inventory Reconciliation ⏸️ **DESIGN PENDING**
**Goal:** Build the missing reconciliation engine

**Design Document:** `docs/automation/DATA_RECONCILIATION_DESIGN.md` (to be created)

**What it does:**
- Scans S3 to inventory current data (what we HAVE)
- Compares against expected coverage schemas (what we SHOULD have)
- Identifies gaps (what's MISSING):
  - Missing games
  - Missing files (PBP, box scores, etc.)
  - Stale data (>7 days old for recent games)
  - Incomplete data (have box scores but missing PBP)
- Prioritizes gaps (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- Generates collection tasks
- Updates `inventory/gaps.json`

**Key Components:**
1. **Enhanced Inventory System** - `inventory/data_inventory.yaml`
2. **Gap Detection Engine** - `scripts/reconciliation/detect_data_gaps.py`
3. **Coverage Analyzer** - Compares inventory vs. schemas

**Expected Results:**
- 📊 Real-time inventory tracking
- 🔍 Comprehensive gap detection
- 📋 Prioritized collection task queue
- 🔄 Continuous reconciliation loop

**Status:** Spec pending, will design after Phase 1

---

### Phase 3: Scraper Orchestrator ⏸️ **DESIGN PENDING**
**Goal:** Intelligent scraper scheduling with global rate limiting

**Design Document:** `docs/automation/SCRAPER_ORCHESTRATOR_DESIGN.md` (to be created)

**What it does:**
- Reads `inventory/gaps.json` (collection tasks)
- Groups tasks by source and scraper
- Applies **global rate limiting** across all scrapers:
  - ESPN: 0.5 req/s (max 43,200/day)
  - NBA API: 0.67 req/s (max 57,888/day)
  - Basketball Reference: 0.083 req/s (max 7,171/day)
  - hoopR: 1.67 req/s (max 144,288/day)
- Schedules scrapers intelligently:
  - Critical tasks first (recent games)
  - Batch similar tasks together
  - Run multiple sources in parallel
  - Respect rate limits globally (not per-scraper)
- Monitors execution
- Updates inventory after completion

**Key Innovation:** **Global rate limiting** across all scrapers, not per-scraper limits. This prevents API abuse and maximizes throughput.

**Example Schedule:**
```
Hour 0-1:  ESPN critical gaps (342 games)
Hour 1-2:  NBA API dashboards (1200 games) + hoopR backfill (2464 games) in parallel
Hour 2-3:  Basketball Reference box scores (5000 games)
Hour 3-24: Continue with high → medium → low priority
```

**Expected Results:**
- 🚀 Efficient multi-source collection
- ⚡ Parallel execution where possible
- 🔒 API limits respected globally
- 📊 Priority-based scheduling
- 📈 Maximized throughput

**Status:** Spec pending, will design after Phase 2

---

### Phase 4: Autonomous Loop ⏸️ **DESIGN PENDING**
**Goal:** Self-healing recursive cycle that runs 24/7

**Design Document:** `docs/automation/AUTONOMOUS_LOOP_DESIGN.md` (to be created)

**What it does:**
```

│  ↓                                                  │

│  ↓                                                  │
│  6. Verify Completion (check for errors)           │
│  ↓                                                  │
│  7. Sleep (configurable: 1h, 6h, 24h)             │
│  ↓                                                  │
│  [REPEAT FOREVER] ←────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Components:**
