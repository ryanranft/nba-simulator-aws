## ðŸ’» Task Execution Workflow (During Work)

### Step 1: Execute Task
Follow the specific workflow for the task type (see sections below)

### Step 2: Document Outcome
- If created/modified code â†’ Document in COMMAND_LOG.md (file, purpose, outcome)
- If solved new error â†’ Offer to add to TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- If made architectural decision â†’ Offer to create ADR

### Step 3: Wait for Confirmation
- **Don't auto-mark complete** unless task is trivial (<5 min) with clear success output
- Wait for user to say: "done", "complete", "looks good", or move to next task

### Step 4: Update PROGRESS.md
- Mark task as âœ… COMPLETE
- Update any time estimates or cost actuals
- Commit the progress update

### Step 5: Suggest Next Action
"Task [X] complete. Next task in PROGRESS.md is [Y]. Should we proceed?"
