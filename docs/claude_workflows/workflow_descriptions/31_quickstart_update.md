# Workflow #31: QUICKSTART.md Update Protocol

**Category:** Documentation
**Priority:** Medium
**When to Use:** When daily workflows or common commands change
**Related Workflows:** #12 (Documentation Triggers), #5 (Task Execution)

---

## Overview

QUICKSTART.md is the daily reference guide for common commands and workflows. This workflow defines when and how to update it.

**Purpose:** Keep quick reference accurate and useful for daily operations.

---

## What is QUICKSTART.md?

**Target audience:** Developers working on project daily
**Content:** Frequently used commands (>1x per week)
**Not included:** One-time setup, rare operations, experimental commands

**Structure:**
- Environment activation
- Common AWS commands (S3, RDS, Glue)
- Git operations
- Database queries
- Make targets
- Daily workflow steps
- Archive management

---

## When to Update QUICKSTART.md

### ‚úÖ UPDATE When:

#### 1. New Daily Commands Added
```markdown
**Trigger:** Command used >1x per week
**Example:**
- New make target for common operation
- AWS CLI shortcut for frequent task
- Database query template used daily
```

**Frequency check:**
```bash
# If you run a command 5+ times, consider adding it
```

#### 2. File Locations Changed
```markdown
**Trigger:** Files or directories moved/reorganized
**Example:**
- Scripts moved to different directory
- Log files relocated
- Config files restructured
```

**Update:**
- All file paths in examples
- Directory structure references
- Archive locations

#### 3. Workflow Shortcuts Discovered
```markdown
**Trigger:** Found faster way to do common task
**Example:**
- Alias that saves time
- One-liner combining multiple commands
- Make target replacing manual steps
```

**Add:**
- Shortcut command
- Explanation of what it does
- When to use it vs manual approach

#### 4. Common Troubleshooting Steps Identified
```markdown
**Trigger:** Same fix needed multiple times
**Example:**
- Conda environment activation issues
- AWS credentials expiring
- Database connection problems
```

**Add:**
- Quick fix command
- When to use it
- Link to TROUBLESHOOTING.md for details

---

### ‚ùå DON'T UPDATE When:

#### 1. Rarely-Used Commands
```markdown
**Threshold:** Less than weekly usage
**Reason:** Belongs in detailed docs, not quick reference
**Example:**
- Annual credential rotation
- One-time AWS resource setup
- Infrastructure migration commands
```

**Alternative:** Document in relevant workflow file instead

#### 2. One-Time Setup Steps
```markdown
**Reason:** Belongs in docs/SETUP.md
**Example:**
- Initial Conda environment creation
- First-time AWS configuration
- SSH key generation
```

#### 3. Experimental Commands
```markdown
**Reason:** Not proven/stable yet
**Example:**
- Testing new approach
- Debugging-only commands
- Prototype scripts
```

**Wait:** Until command is proven and used regularly

#### 4. Already Documented Elsewhere
```markdown
**Reason:** Avoid duplication
**Example:**
- Full workflow already in workflow file
- Detailed setup in SETUP.md
- Architecture in README.md
```

**Instead:** Link to detailed docs

## QUICKSTART.md Update Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Update Trigger

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Is this command used >1x per week?
- [ ] Would I need this command tomorrow?
- [ ] Is this a shortcut/improvement to existing workflow?
- [ ] Is this a common fix needed repeatedly?

If **YES to any**, proceed with update.

---

### Step 2: Determine Section

**QUICKSTART.md sections:**
```markdown
1. Environment Setup (activation commands)
2. Common AWS Commands (S3, RDS, Glue)
3. Database Operations (connections, queries)
4. Git Operations (commit, push, status)
5. Make Targets (automation commands)
6. Daily Workflow (session start to end)
7. Archive Management (finding past conversations)
8. Troubleshooting Quick Fixes (common issues)
```

**Find appropriate section** for your addition.

---

### Step 3: Write Command Entry

**Standard format:**
```markdown
### [Command Name or Task]

**Purpose:** [One-line description]

**Command:**
```bash
actual_command --with-flags
```

**When to use:**
- [Scenario 1]
- [Scenario 2]

**Example:**
```bash
# Specific example with real values
```

**Notes:**
- [Important details]
- [Common gotchas]
```

---

### Step 4: Add Examples

**Good examples:**
```markdown
# Check S3 bucket contents
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/box_scores/ --human-readable --summarize

# Count files in directory
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/box_scores/ --recursive | wc -l

# Download sample file
aws s3 cp s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/box_scores/401584893.json ./sample.json
```

**Include:**
- Real paths (not placeholders)
- Expected output (if helpful)
- Common variations

---

### Step 5: Update Related Sections

**If command replaces old approach:**
```markdown
# Old approach (deprecated)
# aws s3api list-objects --bucket nba-sim-raw-data-lake

# New approach (faster)
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/ --summarize
```

**If command is part of workflow:**
```markdown
### Daily Workflow

1. Activate environment: `conda activate nba-aws`
2. Check system status: `make status`  # [NEW COMMAND]
3. Review PROGRESS.md
4. Begin work
```

---

### Step 6: Test Commands

**Before committing:**
```bash
# Test each command in QUICKSTART.md update
# Ensure they work as documented

# Run from project root
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws

# Test command
[your command here]

# Verify output matches documentation
```

**Common issues:**
- Hardcoded paths (use project root)
- Missing prerequisites (note requirements)
- Environment-specific details (generalize)

---

### Step 7: Commit Update

```bash
# Stage changes
git add QUICKSTART.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Update QUICKSTART.md: Add [command name]

Added: [brief description of what was added]

Reason: [why this command is useful daily]

Usage: [when to use this command]

```bash
# Count all files in bucket
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/ --recursive --summarize | grep "Total Objects" | awk '{print $3}'

# Count files in specific directory
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/box_scores/ --recursive | wc -l
```

**Output:**
```
146115  # Total files in bucket
```

**When to use:**
- Verify S3 sync completed
- Check data extraction progress
- Validate file counts before processing
```

**Commit Message:**
```
Update QUICKSTART.md: Add S3 file counting shortcut

# Good - real paths
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/box_scores/

# Bad - placeholders
aws s3 ls s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/YOUR_DIRECTORY/
```

### Tip 2: Include Expected Output
```markdown
**Output:**
```
2024-01-15 14:30:45  12345 401584893.json
Total Objects: 146115
```
```

### Tip 3: Explain When to Use
```markdown
**When to use:**
- [Specific scenario]
- NOT: "Whenever you need to..." (too vague)
```

### Tip 4: One Command, One Purpose
```markdown
Don't combine unrelated commands in one section
Each entry should be standalone
```

## Removing Outdated Commands

**When to remove:**
- Command no longer works
- Better alternative exists
- No longer used (>3 months)
- Project structure changed

**How to remove:**
```markdown
# Option 1: Delete entirely (if truly obsolete)

# Option 2: Mark as deprecated
### [Old Command] (Deprecated)

**Deprecated:** Use `new_command` instead (see below)

**Old approach:**
[old command for reference]
```
