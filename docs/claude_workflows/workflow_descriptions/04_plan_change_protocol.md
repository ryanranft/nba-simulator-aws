## ðŸ”„ Plan Change Protocol

**When user asks to skip ahead or change the plan:**

1. **Stop and clarify:**
   "This isn't the next task in PROGRESS.md. Current next task is: [X]"
   "Would you like to skip ahead or should we update the plan?"

2. **If user confirms plan change:**
   - Update PROGRESS.md first (mark current task, explain change, update dependencies)
   - Show user the changes
   - Get explicit approval: "Updated plan shows: [summary]. Proceed?"
   - Only then start the new task

3. **Document the change:**
   Add note to PROGRESS.md explaining why sequence changed
