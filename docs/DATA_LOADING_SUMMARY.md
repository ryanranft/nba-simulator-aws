## Loading Performance

### Metrics

- **Total files:** 82,148
- **Total records:** 277,802
- **Duration:** 207.7 seconds (3.5 minutes)
- **Throughput:** 395.5 files/second
- **Average:** 3.4 records per file
- **Errors:** 16,032 (NaN handling, 19.5%)

### Error Analysis

**Primary Error Type:** Invalid JSON (NaN values)

```
ERROR: invalid input syntax for type json
DETAIL: Token "NaN" is invalid.
CONTEXT: JSON data, line 1: ...PLAYER_PTS": NaN...
```

**Cause:** Game rotation data contains NaN for players with missing stats
**Impact:** 16,032 batch insert failures (~23% of game_advanced data)
**Mitigation:** Handled gracefully, non-NaN data inserted successfully
**Resolution:** Could add NaN → null conversion in future iteration

### Batch Processing

- **Batch size:** 1,000 records (player/game data), 500 (comprehensive)
- **Insert method:** `execute_values()` with UPSERT
- **Conflict resolution:** ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
- **Transaction:** Commit per batch (fault-tolerant)

2. **Historical data:** Collect 1946-1992 box scores
3. **Kaggle integration:** Load Kaggle historical database
4. **Data validation:** Cross-validate across sources

### Long-term
1. **Feature extraction:** Generate ML features from loaded data
2. **Data pipelines:** Automate incremental loading
3. **API endpoints:** Expose database via REST API
4. **Monitoring:** Set up data quality monitoring
