## Critical Context

### Two Separate Initiatives (DO NOT CONFUSE)

#### 1. Phase 0 PostgreSQL Work (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
- **What:** Archive MongoDB, implement PostgreSQL JSONB/RAG
- **Status:** Done and deployed (Oct 25, 2025)
- **Location:** `docs/phases/phase_0/0.0010_postgresql_jsonb_storage/` (and 0.0011, 0.0012)
- **Outcome:** PostgreSQL JSONB ‚úÖ, RAG + pgvector ‚úÖ, RAG + LLM ‚úÖ

#### 2. Full Codebase Refactoring (üìã READY TO START)
- **What:** Reorganize 4,055+ files into `nba_simulator/` package
- **Status:** Plans imported, NOT started
- **Location:** `docs/refactoring_plans/`
- **Timeline:** 14 weeks (7 phases)

**These are completely separate!** The refactoring plan is about code organization, not database architecture.

---

## What the Refactoring Plan Does

### ‚úÖ It WILL:
- Reorganize 1,672 Python scripts into proper package structure
- Create `nba_simulator/` package with proper imports
- Move 643 tests into organized structure
- Reorganize 1,720 documentation files
- Make imports work: `from nba_simulator.etl import ESPNScraper`
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Ensure zero data loss

### ‚ùå It Will NOT:
- Change database architecture
- Implement MongoDB (not mentioned in plans)
- Add new features
- Modify existing functionality
- Touch PostgreSQL JSONB/RAG work (already complete)

---

## Where to Start

### Phase 0: Pre-Flight Safety (Week 0)

**Goal:** Ensure zero risk before touching any code

**Tasks:**

#### 1. Discover Active Systems
```bash
# Check for cron jobs
crontab -l

# Check for systemd timers
systemctl list-units --type=timer | grep nba

# Check for LaunchAgents (macOS)
launchctl list | grep nba
```

#### 2. Answer Critical Questions
- [ ] What is the `temporal_events` table (5.8 GB)?
- [ ] Which Phase 8 scripts are running?
- [ ] Is ADCE autonomous loop active?
- [ ] Which scrapers run on schedule?

#### 3. Create Baselines
```bash
# Database backup
pg_dump > backups/pre_refactor_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Git safety tag
git tag pre-refactor-comprehensive-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin --tags

# File structure baseline
tree -L 3 > structure_before_refactoring.txt
```

#### 4. Set Up Monitoring
```bash
# Start monitoring dashboard
python docs/refactoring_plans/scripts/refactor_dashboard.py
```

**See:** `docs/refactoring_plans/execution/COMPLETE_REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` lines 395-447 for complete Phase 0 checklist

---

## Critical Constraints

### Must Protect (DO NOT BREAK)

1. **Database:** 20M+ records across 40 tables
2. **DIMS Monitoring:** Active system health monitoring
3. **Phase 8:** Box score generation (actively running)
4. **ADCE:** Autonomous 24/7 data collection
5. **Unknown Cron Jobs:** Must discover before moving files

### Safety Protocols

- ‚úÖ Zero data loss (verify table counts continuously)
- ‚úÖ Zero downtime (all existing scripts must work)
- ‚úÖ Continuous monitoring (dashboard running)
- ‚úÖ Emergency rollback prepared (git tags + backups)
- ‚úÖ Additive only initially (create new, keep old)

---

## Current Project State

**Location:** `/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws`

**File Counts:**
- Total: 4,055+ files
- Python scripts: 1,672 (scattered across 10+ directories)
- Tests: 643 (no clear organization)
- Markdown docs: 1,720
- SQL files: Various

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL RDS 15.14
- 40 tables
- 20M+ records (esp. play_by_play)

**Key Systems:**
- DIMS: Active monitoring
- ADCE: Autonomous data collection (24/7)
- Phase 8: Box score generation
- Multiple scrapers: ESPN, Basketball Reference, hoopR, NBA API

## What to Ask the User

Before beginning, confirm:

1. **Are we ready to start Phase 0 Pre-Flight Safety?**
   - This involves discovery (no code changes)
   - Discovers active processes
   - Creates safety baselines

2. **Any specific concerns about the approach?**
   - Review the plan first?
   - Questions about safety protocols?

3. **Timeline acceptable?**
   - 14 weeks is the safe timeline
   - Can be accelerated if needed (with higher risk)

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Phase 0 - This Week):**
1. Read execution plan completely
2. Run discovery scripts (cron, systemd, launchctl)
3. Answer the 4 critical questions
4. Create safety baselines (backup, git tag, file structure)
5. Document findings

**After Phase 0:**
1. Review Phase 0 discoveries with user
2. Get approval to proceed to Phase 1
3. Begin creating `nba_simulator/` package structure
4. Start with core infrastructure (config, database, utils)

## Important Notes

### ‚úÖ Good to Know
- All work is git-tracked
- Database backups automated
- DIMS monitoring provides safety net
- Can pause/resume at any phase boundary
- Each phase has clear success criteria

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings
- DO NOT skip Phase 0 Pre-Flight Safety
- DO NOT move files before discovery complete
- DO NOT modify database schemas
- DO NOT disable DIMS monitoring
- DO NOT interrupt Phase 8 box score generation

### üìã Remember
- This is about organization, not features
- Keep old scripts as fallback initially
- Test equivalence before removing old code
- Update one module at a time
- Validate continuously

---

**Ready to begin?** Start with Phase 0 Pre-Flight Safety in `execution/COMPLETE_REFACTORING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (line 395).

**Questions?** Review the plan first, then ask specific questions about approach, timeline, or concerns.
