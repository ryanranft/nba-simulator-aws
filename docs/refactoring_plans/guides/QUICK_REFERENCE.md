# NBA Simulator Refactoring - Quick Reference Card

**Generated:** October 26, 2025  
**Production System:** 20M+ records, 7.7 GB database  
**Keep this handy during refactoring!**

---

## üö® Emergency Contacts

### Rollback Immediately If:
- ‚ùå Any table shows data loss (COUNT decreases)
- ‚ùå DIMS monitoring stops updating
- ‚ùå Phase 8 box score generation fails
- ‚ùå Health checks show "critical" status
- ‚ùå Database connection errors persist

### Emergency Rollback Command:
```bash
# STOP EVERYTHING
pkill -f refactor

# ROLLBACK CODE
git checkout pre-refactor-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# VERIFY HEALTH
python scripts/validation/verify_system_health.py

# RESTORE DB (only if corrupted)
psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d nba_simulator < backups/pre_refactor_*.sql
```

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checklist (Run Before Starting)

```bash
# 1. Backup database
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d nba_simulator > backups/pre_refactor_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 2. Create safety tag
git tag pre-refactor-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 3. Document current state
python -c "from nba_mcp_client import query_database; 
print(f'Games: {query_database(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games\")[\"rows\"][0][\"count\"]}')"

# 4. Verify health
python scripts/validation/verify_system_health.py

# 5. Check for running processes
crontab -l > backups/cron_backup.txt
ps aux | grep python > backups/running_processes.txt
```

from nba_simulator.database import DatabaseConnection
DatabaseConnection.initialize_pool()
result = DatabaseConnection.execute_query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games')
print(f'Games: {result[0][\"count\"]:,}')
"
```

### View Latest Health Log
```bash
cat refactoring_logs/latest.json | jq '.overall_status'
```

## üéØ Phase-by-Phase Quick Guide

### Phase 0: Safety (Week 1)
```bash
# Backup and safety infrastructure
pg_dump ... > backups/
git tag pre-refactor-$(date +%Y%m%d)
python refactor_dashboard.py --continuous &
```

### Phase 1: Parallel Structure (Week 2)
```bash
# Create new package alongside old
bash phase1_setup_production_safe.sh
python scripts/validation/verify_system_health.py
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Phase 2: Dual Operation (Week 3)
```bash
# Both old and new running
pytest tests/integration/test_dual_operation.py -v
python refactor_dashboard.py  # Check for discrepancies
```

### Phase 3: Test Migration (Weeks 4-5)
```bash
# Move tests to centralized structure
mv tests/phases/phase_*/unit/* tests/unit/
pytest tests/ -v --cov=nba_simulator
```

### Phase 4: Code Migration (Weeks 6-8)
```bash
# Gradual migration: utilities ‚Üí monitoring ‚Üí ETL
# NEVER touch: active scrapers, Phase 8, database migrations
```

### Phase 5: Validation (Week 9)
```bash
# Final checks
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
python scripts/validation/verify_system_health.py
python refactor_dashboard.py
```

## üîß Common Queries

### Check All Table Counts
```python
python -c "
from nba_simulator.database import DatabaseConnection
DatabaseConnection.initialize_pool()

tables = ['games', 'play_by_play', 'hoopr_play_by_play', 
          'box_score_players', 'box_score_teams']
for table in tables:
    result = DatabaseConnection.execute_query(f'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {table}')
    print(f'{table:25} {result[0][\"count\"]:>12,}')
"
```

### Check DIMS Status
```python
python -c "
from nba_simulator.database import DatabaseConnection
DatabaseConnection.initialize_pool()
result = DatabaseConnection.execute_query('''
    SELECT MAX(created_at) as last_update 
    FROM dims_metrics_snapshots
''')
print(f'DIMS last update: {result[0][\"last_update\"]}')
"
```

### Check Phase 8 Activity
```python
python -c "
from nba_simulator.database import DatabaseConnection
DatabaseConnection.initialize_pool()
result = DatabaseConnection.execute_query('''
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count, MAX(created_at) as last_update
    FROM box_score_snapshots
    WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
''')
print(f'Phase 8 activity (7d): {result[0]}')
"
```

# Compare with baseline
git diff pre-refactor-$(date +%Y%m%d) -- tests/
```

### Health Check Shows Warning

2. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
3. **Never delete old code** until fully validated
4. **Monitor continuously** during active migration
5. **Test on dev/staging first** if available
6. **Keep rollback procedure handy**
7. **Document any deviations** from plan
8. **Ask for help early** if unsure

## üìû Quick Help

### Get System Status
```bash
python refactor_dashboard.py

## üéì Remember

- **Production system with 20M+ records** - treat with care
- **Parallel structure, not replacement** - old code stays
- **Validate everything** - trust but verify
- **Rollback immediately** if any data loss detected
- **Document as you go** - future you will thank you

---

**When in doubt, run the health check and consult the comprehensive guide!**

```bash
python scripts/validation/verify_system_health.py
cat REFACTORING_GUIDE_v2_PRODUCTION.md
```
