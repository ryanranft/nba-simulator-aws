## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Real implementation takes longer than estimated | High | High | Start with top 5, measure velocity |
| Integration breaks existing code | High | Medium | Test thoroughly, use feature flags |
| Advanced features need expensive compute | Medium | High | Start with simple features first |
| Dependencies on AWS resources cost money | High | Medium | Estimate costs before deploying |

## Next Actions

1. **Choose starting point** - Recommend top 5 implementations (40 hours)
2. **Set up development environment** - Ensure all dependencies installed
3. **Create integration branch** - `git checkout -b integrate-book-recommendations`
4. **Implement rec_001** - Start with data validation (8 hours)
5. **Measure impact** - Validate improvement before continuing
