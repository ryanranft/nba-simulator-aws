2. ‚è∏Ô∏è Decide which Phase 1 data types to prioritize
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Extend comprehensive scraper to include new data types

### Short-term
4. Implement Phase 1 data types (adjusted shooting, per 100, games, rookies)
5. Test on single season (2024)
6. Run full collection for modern era (2001-2025)

### Long-term
7. Extend to Phase 2 (team-level insights)
8. Evaluate Phase 4 (player granularity) necessity
9. Implement selective player collection (only top players)

## Conclusion

Basketball Reference contains significantly more data than initially documented. The most valuable additions are:

**Tier 1 (Immediate Value):**
- Adjusted Shooting (shooting efficiency)
- Per 100 Possessions (pace-adjusted)
- Game Results (schedule context)
- Rookies (first-year tracking)
- All-Rookie Teams (quality indicators)

**Tier 2 (Strategic Value):**
- Team Starting Lineups (chemistry)
- Team Game Logs (trends)
- Per Minute Stats (efficiency)
- Season Leaders (dominance tracking)

**Tier 3 (Deep Analysis):**
- Player Game Logs (granular, very high volume)
- Player Splits (situational, very high volume)

**Total Potential:** 5-10M additional records if including player-level granularity, or ~350,000 records for Phases 1-3 (more manageable).

**Recommendation:** Focus on Phases 1-2 first (350,000 records, high value, manageable volume), then evaluate Phase 4 based on ML model needs.
