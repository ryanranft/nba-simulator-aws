### Storage Impact

**Current Plan (Tiers 1-4):**
- Records: 350K-10M (depending on Tier 4 selection)
- Storage: 260 MB - 10 GB
- Cost: $0.006 - 0.23/month

**With All New NBA Data (Tiers 5A-9):**
- Additional Records: +140K
- Additional Storage: +300 MB
- Additional Cost: +$0.007/month
- **Total: 490K-10M records, 560 MB - 10 GB, $0.013 - 0.24/month**

**With Non-NBA Leagues (Tiers 10-13):**
- Additional Records: +380K
- Additional Storage: +800 MB
- Additional Cost: +$0.018/month
- **Grand Total: 870K-10M records, 1.36 GB - 11 GB, $0.031 - 0.26/month**

**Conclusion:** Even collecting ALL basketball data from Sports Reference is negligible cost (<$0.30/month).

---

### Time Investment

**Current Plan:** 40-60 hours (Tiers 1-4, selective Tier 4)

**Full NBA Collection:**
- Tiers 1-4: 40-60 hours
- Tiers 5-9: 27-37 hours
- **Total NBA: 67-97 hours**

**All Basketball Data:**
- Tiers 1-9 (NBA): 67-97 hours
- Tiers 10-13 (Other leagues): 73-100 hours
- **Grand Total: 140-197 hours**

**Spread over:**
- 10 weeks @ 14-20 hours/week = Comprehensive collection
- 20 weeks @ 7-10 hours/week = Leisurely pace

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Update PHASE_0_BASKETBALL_REFERENCE_EXPANSION.md** with:
   - 76 new NBA data types (Tiers 5A-9)
   - 6 new league sections (Tiers 10-13)
   - Updated implementation timeline
   - Storage and cost projections
   - Prioritization matrix

2. **Create sub-phase files:**
   - PHASE_0_WNBA_COLLECTION.md (if pursuing Tier 10)
   - PHASE_0_ABA_BAA_COLLECTION.md (if pursuing Tiers 7-8)
   - PHASE_0_INTERNATIONAL_COLLECTION.md (if pursuing Tier 12)
   - PHASE_0_COLLEGE_COLLECTION.md (if pursuing Tier 13)

3. **Confirm with user:**
   - Which tiers to pursue?
   - NBA-only or all basketball?
   - Selective vs. comprehensive approach?

4. **Update comprehensive scraper:**
   - Extend to support new data types
   - Add league-specific scraping modes
   - Update rate limiting for multiple domains

---

## CONCLUSION

**Basketball-Reference.com contains 234+ distinct basketball data types across 7 leagues/domains.**

**Current plan captures 32 NBA data types (14% of available data).**

**To achieve COMPLETE basketball data coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Collect all 119 NBA data types (Tiers 1-9)
- ‚úÖ Collect ABA & BAA for historical completeness (Tiers 7-8)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optionally collect WNBA, G League, International, College (Tiers 10-13)

**For panel data purposes, priority recommendation:**
1. **Tiers 1-4** (already planned) - Essential foundation
2. **Tiers 5A-5C** (NBA salaries + granular stats) - High analytical value
3. **Tiers 7-8** (ABA & BAA) - Historical completeness to 1946
4. **Tier 6** (Expanded awards) - Recognition tracking
5. **Tiers 10-13** (Other leagues) - Only if multi-league analysis desired

**Estimated total time for comprehensive NBA collection (Tiers 1-9): 67-97 hours**

**User decision required:** Scope of collection (NBA-only vs. all basketball)?

---

**Document Status:** Complete and ready for user review
**Next Action:** User confirmation of collection scope
