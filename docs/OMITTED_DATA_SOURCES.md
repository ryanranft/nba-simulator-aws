# Omitted Data Sources - What We're NOT Scraping

**Created:** October 6, 2025
**Purpose:** Document data sources identified but NOT implemented
**Status:** Reference for future enhancement opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

Your original plan identified **5 data sources** for the multi-source integration strategy:

1. ✅ **ESPN** - Already have (1993-2025, 44,828 games in PostgreSQL)
2. ✅ **Basketball Reference** - Currently scraping (1946-2025, 79 years)
3. ✅ **NBA.com Stats API** - Currently scraping (1996-2025, 30 years)
4. ❌ **Kaggle Basketball Database** - OMITTED
5. ❌ **SportsDataverse** - OMITTED

**What you're implementing:** 3 of 5 sources (209 features, 30 years ML-ready)
**What you're omitting:** 2 sources (Kaggle + SportsDataverse)

---

## Omitted Source #1: Kaggle Basketball Database

### What It Offers

**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball
**GitHub:** https://github.com/wyattowalsh/nbadb
**Format:** SQLite database (updated daily)

**Coverage:**
- **Teams:** 30 NBA teams
- **Players:** 4,800+ players
- **Games:** 65,000+ games (1946-2025)
- **Box Scores:** 95%+ coverage
- **Play-by-Play:** 13M+ rows

**Unique Features:**
- Pre-packaged SQLite database (no scraping needed!)
- Daily automated updates via Kaggle cron
- Comprehensive historical coverage since 1946
- Built using nba-api (same as NBA.com Stats API)
- Multiple tables with relational schema

### Database Schema (From Documentation)

**Estimated tables:**
- `teams` - Team metadata
- `players` - Player information
- `games` - Game results and metadata
- `team_game_stats` - Team box scores
- `player_game_stats` - Player box scores
- `play_by_play` - Play-by-play sequences
- `game_info` - Game details
- `officials` - Referee information
- `inactive_players` - Injury/inactive lists
- `line_scores` - Quarter-by-quarter scoring

**Total features:** 50-100+ (varies by table)

### Why You're Omitting It

**Reasons:**

1. **Redundancy:** Built from same source as NBA.com Stats API (stats.nba.com)
2. **Coverage overlap:** 1996-2025 (same as NBA.com Stats API)
3. **No unique features:** Same 92 tracking features as direct NBA API scraping
4. **Download complexity:** Requires Kaggle account, manual download
5. **Maintenance:** One more dependency to manage
6. **Size:** 2-5 GB SQLite database (vs targeted scraping)

**What you'd gain:**
- Pre-processed relational schema
- Potentially cleaner data (community-validated)
- Easier querying (SQL vs JSON parsing)
- Daily updates without scraping

**What you'd lose:**
- Nothing (100% redundant with NBA.com Stats API)

### Opportunity Cost

**Effort to implement:** 2-4 hours
- Download database from Kaggle
- Load into RDS or query locally
- Map tables to your schema
- Set up monthly update process

**Value added:** LOW (mostly redundant)
- Same coverage as NBA.com Stats API (1996-2025)
- Same features (built from stats.nba.com)
- Main benefit: Pre-packaged convenience

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ Skip for now
- You're already getting NBA.com Stats data directly
- Kaggle database offers no unique features
- Consider only if direct scraping fails

## Omitted Source #2: SportsDataverse

### What It Offers

**Source:** https://www.sportsdataverse.org/
**Python Package:** `sportsdataverse` (https://pypi.org/project/sportsdataverse/)
**GitHub:** https://github.com/sportsdataverse/sportsdataverse-py

**Description:**
Open-source sports data aggregator providing unified access to multiple sports APIs.

**Coverage:**
- **NBA & WNBA:** 15+ seasons of play-by-play and box scores
- **College Basketball:** Men's and women's
- **Data sources:** ESPN, kenpom.com, NCAA website
- **Live data:** Real-time game data via ESPN CDN

### Key Features

**NBA Stats API Wrapper:**
- ~132 functions wrapping NBA Stats API
- Function names start with `nba_`
- Same endpoints as direct NBA.com Stats access

**Multi-Sport Support:**
- NFL, MLB, NHL, CFB, WNBA
- Unified API across all sports
- Consistent data structure

**Convenience Functions:**
```python
from sportsdataverse.nba import nba_schedule, nba_pbp, nba_player_box

# Get schedule
schedule = nba_schedule.espn_nba_schedule(season=2024)

# Get play-by-play
pbp = nba_pbp.espn_nba_pbp(game_id='401234567')

# Get box scores
box = nba_player_box.espn_nba_player_box(game_id='401234567')
```

**Live Game Data:**
- Access to ESPN's live play-by-play
- Live box scores with shot locations
- Real-time updates during games

### Why You're Omitting It

**Reasons:**

1. **ESPN wrapper:** Primarily wraps ESPN.com (which you already have)
2. **Coverage overlap:** Same ESPN data you scraped (1993-2025)
3. **NBA API redundancy:** Wraps stats.nba.com (you're scraping directly)
4. **Dependency risk:** Adds Python package dependency
5. **Abstraction layer:** Extra layer between you and raw data
6. **Limited historical:** Only 15+ seasons (worse than your 33 years ESPN)
7. **No unique features:** All data available from ESPN or NBA.com Stats

**What you'd gain:**
- Easier API (Python functions vs raw scraping)
- Multi-sport expansion path (NFL, MLB, NHL)
- Live game data support
- Community-maintained package

**What you'd lose:**
- Control over data format
- Direct access to raw JSON
- Ability to customize requests
- Independence from third-party package

### SportsDataverse vs Your Current Approach

| Feature | SportsDataverse | Your Scrapers |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **ESPN data** | Via wrapper | Direct scraping ✅ |
| **NBA Stats** | Via wrapper | Direct API calls ✅ |
| **Coverage** | 15+ seasons | 33 years ESPN ✅ |
| **Customization** | Limited | Full control ✅ |
| **Dependencies** | Python package | None ✅ |
| **Multi-sport** | Yes ✅ | NBA only |
| **Live data** | Yes ✅ | No |
| **Historical** | Limited | 79 years (Basketball Ref) ✅ |

### Opportunity Cost

**Effort to implement:** 1-2 hours
- Install package: `pip install sportsdataverse`
- Test API calls
- Map to your schema
- Integrate with existing pipeline

**Value added:** LOW (mostly redundant)
- Same ESPN data you already have
- Same NBA.com Stats data you're scraping
- Only unique: Multi-sport support (not needed)

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ Skip for now
- You have better ESPN coverage (33 vs 15 years)
- You're getting NBA Stats data directly
- No unique NBA features
- Consider only for multi-sport expansion

## Unique Features You're Missing

### 1. Live Game Data ⚠️

**Sources offering:** ESPN (via SportsDataverse), NBA.com Stats API

**What you'd get:**
- Real-time play-by-play during games
- Live box score updates
- In-game shot location data
- Quarter-by-quarter updates

**Why you're missing it:**
- Your scrapers only get historical data
- No real-time streaming implementation
- Would require WebSocket or polling

**Impact:** LOW for historical ML training, HIGH for live predictions

**Future consideration:** Implement if you want real-time predictions

---

### 2. Pre-Packaged Database Schema 📦

**Source offering:** Kaggle Basketball Database

**What you'd get:**
- Pre-designed relational schema
- Foreign keys and indexes already set up
- Community-validated data quality
- Daily automated updates

**Why you're missing it:**
- You're building custom schema for your needs
- Full control over data structure
- No dependency on Kaggle updates

**Impact:** LOW (you have custom schema control)

**Future consideration:** Reference for schema design ideas

---

### 3. Multi-Sport Data 🏈🏒⚾

**Source offering:** SportsDataverse

**What you'd get:**
- NFL, MLB, NHL, CFB data
- Unified API across sports
- Same pipeline for multiple sports
- Cross-sport analysis potential

**Why you're missing it:**
- Project is NBA-focused
- No multi-sport ML models planned
- Would complicate pipeline

**Impact:** ZERO for NBA project, HIGH for multi-sport expansion

**Future consideration:** Only if expanding to other sports
