# Next Steps - Options for Continuation

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Current Status:** Plus/Minus System 100% Complete & Deployed to RDS PostgreSQL âœ…

## Option 1: Integrate Plus/Minus System with ML Pipelines ðŸ¤–

**What:** Connect the plus/minus tables to existing ML feature engineering workflows

**Why:** Unlock the full ML potential of lineup and player impact features

**Tasks:**
1. Add plus/minus features to `scripts/ml/unified_feature_extractor.py`
2. Create lineup optimization ML model using vw_lineup_plus_minus
3. Create player impact prediction model using vw_on_off_analysis
4. Integrate possession-based intervals (10, 25, 50, 100) with existing box score intervals
5. Add plus/minus features to rec_11 (Advanced Feature Engineering)

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** HIGH - Enables 100+ new ML features
**Files to modify:** 3-5 existing ML scripts

---

## Option 2: Populate Full Dataset (44,826 Games) ðŸ“Š

**What:** Populate all 3 plus/minus tables with complete historical NBA data

**Why:** Production-ready dataset for real ML training

**Tasks:**
1. Run `populate_plus_minus_tables.py` for all 44,826 games
2. Monitor population progress and handle errors
3. Validate data quality at scale
4. Generate summary statistics

**Time Estimate:** 2-4 hours (mostly automated)
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Nice to have, but test data (1 game) is sufficient for development
**Storage:** ~18 GB total (122M rows across 3 tables)

---

## Option 3: Continue Book Recommendations (246 Remaining) ðŸ“š

**What:** Implement next recommendations from the 270-recommendation master list

**Why:** Core project roadmap - systematic improvement across all areas

**Current Progress:** 24/270 completed (8.9%)

**Next Recommended Blocks:**
1. **Block 2 (Recs 33-64)** - Data Quality & Validation (32 recs)
2. **Block 3 (Recs 65-96)** - Advanced Analytics (32 recs)
3. **Block 4 (Recs 97-128)** - Model Enhancement (32 recs)

**Example Next Rec:** #33 - Data Quality Dashboard (3-4 hours)

**Time Estimate:** Variable (2-8 hours per recommendation)
**Impact:** HIGH - Systematic improvement across entire project
