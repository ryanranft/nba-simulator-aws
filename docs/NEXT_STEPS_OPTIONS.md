## ðŸ¤” Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Multi-Source Data Integration if:
- âœ… You want to **maximize ML accuracy immediately**
- âœ… You need defensive impact metrics (not in ESPN)
- âœ… You want historical data (1946-1998)
- âœ… You prefer **shorter timeline** (4 weeks vs 8 weeks)
- âœ… You want to **train better ML models** first
- âœ… You need tracking data (player movement, hustle stats)

### Choose Advanced Simulation Framework if:
- âœ… You want **sophisticated game forecasting**
- âœ… You need to **forecast every statistic** (not just win/loss)
- âœ… You want possession-by-possession simulation
- âœ… You're interested in **econometric modeling**
- âœ… You want to capture **momentum, fatigue, regime-switching**
- âœ… You prefer research-oriented, complex modeling

### Or Do Both (Recommended Sequence):

**Phase 1: Multi-Source Integration First (4 weeks)**
- Rationale: Better data improves simulation accuracy
- Get 209 features available for modeling
- Shorter timeline to first results
- Econometric models will benefit from richer features

**Then Phase 2: Advanced Simulation (6-8 weeks)**
- Rationale: Now you have 209 features to power econometric models
- Panel data models benefit from tracking data
- Hierarchical Bayesian benefits from advanced metrics
- Total timeline: 10-12 weeks to full sophistication

## ðŸ“‹ Ready to Start?

### To Begin Multi-Source Integration:

```bash
# Week 1, Day 1: Basketball Reference scraper
# See docs/archive/planning/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md Sub-Phase 1.10

# Option 1: Start with one month test
python scripts/etl/scrape_basketball_reference.py --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-01-31

# Option 2: Start with NBA.com Stats expansion
python scripts/etl/expand_nba_stats_scraper.py --endpoints all --sample-size 100
```

### To Begin Advanced Simulation:

```bash
# Week 1: Panel data preparation
# See docs/ADVANCED_SIMULATION_FRAMEWORK.md Sub-Phase 4.5.1

# Install required packages
pip install linearmodels pymc arviz statsmodels

# Create panel data structure
python scripts/simulation/prepare_panel_data.py --start-season 2020 --end-season 2024
```

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendation

**Suggested approach: Start with Multi-Source Integration**

**Why:**
1. Shorter timeline (4 weeks vs 8 weeks)
2. Immediate ML accuracy boost (+15-20%)
3. Provides richer data for advanced simulation later
4. Lower cost ($5-8/month vs $5-10/month)
5. Foundation for everything else

**Then:** Once 209 features are available, implement advanced simulation with much richer data to power econometric models.

**Total journey:** 10-12 weeks to full sophistication
**Total additional cost:** $10-18/month (well under $150/month budget)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Point

**What would you like to work on first?**

**Option A:** Multi-source data integration (4 weeks â†’ 209 features)
**Option B:** Advanced simulation framework (6-8 weeks â†’ econometric models)
**Option C:** Both in sequence (A then B, 10-12 weeks total)

All planning documentation is complete. Ready to begin implementation immediately.
