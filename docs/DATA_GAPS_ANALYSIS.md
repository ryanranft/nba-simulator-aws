   ```bash
   # For 2022-2025 seasons
   python3 scripts/etl/scrape_espn_missing_pbp.py --seasons 2022,2023,2024
   
   # For 2021-22 gaps
   python3 scripts/etl/scrape_espn_missing_pbp.py --season 2021 --fill-gaps
   ```

2. **Update Recent Games**
   ```bash
   # Update 2024-25 ongoing season
   python3 scripts/etl/scrape_espn_recent.py --days-back 30
   ```

### Phase 2: Data Validation (HIGH)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

1. **Cross-Source Validation**
   ```bash
   # Compare ESPN vs NBA.com Stats for sample games
   python3 scripts/validation/compare_data_sources.py --sample 100
   ```

2. **Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   # Validate PBP data integrity
   python3 scripts/validation/validate_pbp_integrity.py
   ```

### Phase 3: Master Database Integration (MEDIUM)

**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours

1. **Create Unified Schema**
   ```bash
   # Design master database schema
   python3 scripts/db/design_master_schema.py
   ```
