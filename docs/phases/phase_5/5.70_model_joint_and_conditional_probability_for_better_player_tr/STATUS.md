# Recommendation Status: Model Joint and Conditional Probability for Better Player Trajectory Prediction

**ID:** rec_100
**Name:** Model Joint and Conditional Probability for Better Player Trajectory Prediction
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** Generative Deep Learning
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 24 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Improve the accuracy of player trajectory prediction by modeling not just trajectories themselves, but also the shot clock time remaining, and other game-state conditions. Consider trajectory models with Gaussian Mixture Model layers.

---

## Expected Impact

Increased predictability of the model and the ability to generate conditional statements based on model data.
