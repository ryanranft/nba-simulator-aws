## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Multiple
**Category:** Testing

---

## Recommendation Details

Integrate automated evaluation of trained machine learning models into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Implement validation metrics (R2 score, precision, recall) to ensure model performance meets pre-defined acceptance criteria.

---

## Technical Details

Implement CI/CD to automatically build and evaluate, use `sklearn` or similar metrics to measure the quality of models, and fail the deployment if threshold isn't met.

---

## Expected Impact

Enhanced testing and continuous delivery with an automated performance validation tool.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 20 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
