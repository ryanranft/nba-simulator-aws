## Recommendation Details

Employ counterfactual evaluation techniques to estimate the true performance of recommendation systems by accounting for action bias. This involves estimating how users would have reacted to different recommendations than what they actually received.

---

## Technical Details

Collect data on user interactions and model predicted rewards for both the chosen and unchosen recommendations. Use inverse propensity scoring (IPS) or similar methods to estimate the counterfactual reward.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduced selection bias and more accurate estimates of recommendation system performance.
