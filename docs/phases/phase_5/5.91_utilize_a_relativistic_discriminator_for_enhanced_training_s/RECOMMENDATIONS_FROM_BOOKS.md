## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 12
**Category:** Performance

---

## Recommendation Details

Transition the discriminator architecture to use a relativistic discriminator, which takes both original and generated image sets into account during calculations.

---

## Technical Details

Implement the relativistic discriminator using the approach shown in Chapter 12. The new configuration enables a better result when the Generator doesn't have a strong ability to compete.

---

## Expected Impact

Ensure the performance is more resilient and easier to manage

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 32 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
