## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 11
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Using GANs to augment existing datasets where collecting new data or applying for access is either too difficult or impossible.

---

## Technical Details

There is often a tradeoff between the number of data instances and their corresponding quality, and in data-contrained medical sets, you are limited by the number of scans that one can apply for access to, making each scan precious. Using a DCGAN, you can dramatically improve the number of synthetic instances available.

---

## Expected Impact

Increase number of training examples while maintaining model relevance and validity. Useful when number of samples and corresponding variety is limited.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 40 hours
