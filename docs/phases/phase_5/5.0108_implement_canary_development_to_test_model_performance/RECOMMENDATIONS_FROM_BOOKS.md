## Source Information

**Book:** building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
**Chapter:** Chapter 10
**Category:** Architecture

## Recommendation Details

The goal of canary development should be to test new models in production to get realistic data on model performance. That requires some care to ensure user experience is not degraded.

---

## Technical Details

Create an A/B testing system where only a small fraction of users, or an internal testing group, is routed to the new model.

---

## Expected Impact

More confidence that live deployments do not degrade the system

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 24 hours
