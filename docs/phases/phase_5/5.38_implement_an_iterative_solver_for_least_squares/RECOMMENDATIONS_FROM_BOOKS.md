## Recommendation Details

Use iterative methods, like gradient descent, to solve overdetermined least-squares problems when solving Ax = b directly is too computationally expensive. This can improve processing time.

---

## Technical Details

Implement methods such as conjugate gradients or successive over-relaxation. Apply to problems that have millions of simultaneous equations.

---

## Expected Impact

Improves the efficiency and speed of large-scale data analytics, enhancing the real-time capabilities of the analytics platform.
