# Recommendation Status: Implement an Iterative Solver for Least Squares

**ID:** rec_061
**Name:** Implement an Iterative Solver for Least Squares
**Phase:** 5 (Performance)
**Source Books:** ML Math
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 20 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Use iterative methods, like gradient descent, to solve overdetermined least-squares problems when solving Ax = b directly is too computationally expensive. This can improve processing time.

---

## Expected Impact

Improves the efficiency and speed of large-scale data analytics, enhancing the real-time capabilities of the analytics platform.
