## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Chapter 4: Text Classification
**Category:** Data Processing

---

## Recommendation Details

To prepare text for classification related to players, transform textual descriptions into numerical sequences using tokenization and padding. Implement strategies to manage variable-length player descriptions effectively.

---

## Technical Details

Use `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer` and `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`. Limit the vocabulary size and determine an appropriate sequence length based on the length of the player description.

---

## Expected Impact

This allows text from player descriptions to be included in models.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 16 hours

---

## Dependencies
