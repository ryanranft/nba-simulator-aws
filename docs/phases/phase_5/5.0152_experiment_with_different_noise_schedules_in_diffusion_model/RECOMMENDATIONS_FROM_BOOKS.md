## Recommendation Details

Implement and test different noise schedules (linear, cosine, etc.) in the diffusion models. Different noise schedules significantly affect the performance of generating images. The optimal noise schedule may vary based on the dataset characteristics and computational resources.

---

## Technical Details

Implement different noise schedules in the diffusion models. Tune the beta_start and beta_end values for each schedule. Compare the image quality using visual inspection and metrics.

---

## Expected Impact

Optimize noise schedule with a good balance between noise and image details.
