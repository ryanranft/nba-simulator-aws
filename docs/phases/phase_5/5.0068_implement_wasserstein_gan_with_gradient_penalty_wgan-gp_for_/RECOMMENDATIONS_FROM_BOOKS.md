**Recommendation:** Implement Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) for Improved GAN Training Stability
**Source Book:** Generative Deep Learning
**Priority:** IMPORTANT

## Source Information

**Book:** Generative Deep Learning
**Chapter:** Chapter 4: Generative Adversarial Networks
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Replace the standard GAN loss function with the Wasserstein loss and add a gradient penalty term to enforce the Lipschitz constraint. This improves training stability and reduces mode collapse.

---

## Technical Details

Implement the WGAN-GP loss function. Use the GradientTape to compute the gradient penalty. Carefully choose learning rates for generator and discriminator and use beta values of 0.0 and 0.9. Train WGAN-GP with gradient penalty of 10.

---

## Expected Impact

More stable GAN training, higher-quality generated images, and reduced mode collapse.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 12 hours

---

## Dependencies

**Required Prerequisites:**

- Implement Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for Shot Chart Generation
