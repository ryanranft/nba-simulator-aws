df = pipeline.generate_temporal_features(df)

# Step 2: Cumulative features (career totals, season stats)
df = pipeline.generate_cumulative_features(df)

# Step 3: Interaction features (home×rest, player×opponent)
df = pipeline.generate_interaction_features(df)

# Step 4: Contextual features (schedule, travel, altitude)
df = pipeline.generate_contextual_features(df)

# Step 5: Derived features (efficiency metrics, advanced stats)
df = pipeline.generate_derived_features(df)

# Step 6: Engineered features (form, consistency, trajectories)
df = pipeline.generate_engineered_features(df)

# Step 7: Feature selection (variance, correlation, ranking)
selected_features = pipeline.select_features(df, target='win', max_features=100)
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Pipeline Execution

```python
from implement_rec_11 import AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline
import pandas as pd

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()

# Setup (loads rec_22 panel data system)
pipeline.setup()

# Load your player-game data
df = pd.read_parquet('player_games.parquet')

# Execute full pipeline
results = pipeline.execute(demo_data=df)

# Results include:
# - Engineered DataFrame with 80-100 features
# - Feature catalog by category
# - Selected feature names
# - Execution metrics
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Custom configuration for specific use case
config = {
    "lag_periods": [1, 3, 5],  # Fewer lags
    "rolling_windows": [5, 10],  # Shorter windows
    "include_temporal": True,
    "include_cumulative": True,
    "include_interaction": False,  # Skip interactions
    "include_contextual": True,
    "include_derived": True,
}

pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline(config=config)
pipeline.setup()
results = pipeline.execute(demo_data=df)
```

### Feature Selection Only

```python
# If you already have features and just want selection
from implement_rec_11 import AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline

pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()
selected_features = pipeline.select_features(
    df=your_dataframe,
    target_col='win',
    max_features=50
)

print(f"Selected {len(selected_features)} features:")
print(selected_features)
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Modular design**: Separate methods for each feature category enable easy customization
2. **Panel data integration**: Building on rec_22 eliminated need to reimplement temporal operations
3. **Automatic feature catalog**: Tracking features by category aids interpretability
4. **Configurable pipeline**: Users can enable/disable feature types based on needs
5. **Correlation filtering**: Removing redundant features significantly reduced model overfitting

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Missing data handling**: Early games lack lag features
   - **Solution**: Use expanding windows with `min_periods=1`

2. **Memory explosion**: Naive implementation generated 300+ features
   - **Solution**: Implement correlation-based feature selection

3. **Computational cost**: Rolling windows slow for large datasets
   - **Solution**: Vectorized pandas operations, groupby caching

4. **Interaction complexity**: Combinatorial explosion of possible interactions
   - **Solution**: Focus on domain-knowledge-driven interactions (home×rest, player×opponent)

5. **Feature leakage**: Accidentally using future data in features
   - **Solution**: All features use `.expanding()` or explicit lag periods

### Performance Optimizations

- **Groupby caching**: Reuse grouped objects across multiple operations
- **Vectorized operations**: Pandas vectorization 100x faster than row-by-row
- **Selective computation**: Only calculate requested feature categories
- **Correlation matrix optimization**: Use upper triangle only (50% fewer comparisons)

---

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Additions (Not Yet Implemented):**

1. **Deep interaction features**: Higher-order interactions (3-way, 4-way)
2. **Polynomial features**: Squared/cubed terms for non-linear relationships
3. **Fourier features**: Capture cyclical patterns (day of week, month)
4. **Automated feature engineering**: Use FeatureTools or similar libraries
5. **Feature importance filtering**: Select features based on model importance, not just correlation
6. **Distributed computation**: Dask/Ray for multi-season feature generation
7. **Feature versioning**: Track feature definitions and changes over time
8. **Domain-specific features**: Matchup-specific features (vs tall defenders, vs zone defense)

## Integration with Other Systems

### rec_22 (Panel Data) - REQUIRED

rec_11 directly depends on rec_22's panel data infrastructure:
- `generate_lags()`: Creates lag features
- `generate_rolling_stats()`: Calculates rolling windows
- `generate_cumulative_stats()`: Computes career totals
- Panel index structure: (player_id, game_id, timestamp)

### ml_systems_1 (MLflow)

Feature sets tracked in MLflow:
- Version control for feature configurations
- Log feature catalogs with model runs
- Compare model performance across feature sets

### ml_systems_2 (Drift Detection)

Monitors all 80-100 features for drift:
- Detects when feature distributions change over time
- Alerts when new data differs significantly from training data
- Enables proactive model retraining

### ml_systems_3 (Monitoring)

Tracks feature generation performance:
- Pipeline execution time
- Feature count by category
- Memory usage

## Migration Path for Existing Projects

**If you have raw player-game data, here's how to add advanced features:**

### Step 1: Ensure rec_22 is implemented
```bash
# Check if rec_22 exists
ls /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_0/rec_22_panel_data/implement_rec_22.py

# If missing, implement rec_22 first
```

### Step 2: Prepare your data
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your player-game data
df = pd.read_csv('your_player_games.csv')

# Required columns:
# - player_id, game_id, game_date (for panel structure)
# - points, rebounds, assists, minutes (basic stats)
# - Optional: fg_pct, three_pct, ft_pct, steals, blocks, turnovers
# - Optional contextual: is_home, days_rest, opponent_win_pct
```

### Step 3: Run feature engineering pipeline
```bash
# Run implementation script
python /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_0/rec_11_feature_engineering/implement_rec_11.py
```

### Step 4: Use features in models
```python
from implement_rec_11 import AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline

# Generate features
pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()
pipeline.setup()
results = pipeline.execute(demo_data=df)

# Extract engineered DataFrame
features_df = results['engineered_df']
feature_names = results['selected_feature_names']

# Use in scikit-learn model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

X = features_df[feature_names]
y = features_df['win']  # Your target variable

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
```
