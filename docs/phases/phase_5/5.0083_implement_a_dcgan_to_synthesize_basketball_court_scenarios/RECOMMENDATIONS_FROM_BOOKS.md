## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 4
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Utilize a DCGAN to generate realistic images of basketball court scenarios, such as player formations and ball positions, to augment training data for computer vision tasks.

---

## Technical Details

Use convolutional layers in both Generator and Discriminator. Experiment with batch normalization and Leaky ReLU activations. The generator should input noise vector and output RGB image. Discriminator input RGB and output classification (real/fake).

---

## Expected Impact

Augment training data for object detection (player, ball), action recognition, and court line detection, enabling training more robust machine learning models

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 50 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
