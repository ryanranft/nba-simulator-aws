# Recommendation Status: Implement Semi-Supervised GAN for Player Classification

**ID:** rec_118
**Name:** Implement Semi-Supervised GAN for Player Classification
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 40 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Utilize a Semi-Supervised GAN to improve the accuracy of player classification (e.g., position, skill level) by leveraging a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled player statistics.

---

## Expected Impact

Improve player classification accuracy by leveraging unlabeled data, especially useful when labeled data is scarce.
