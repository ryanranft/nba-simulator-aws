## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 7
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Utilize a Semi-Supervised GAN to improve the accuracy of player classification (e.g., position, skill level) by leveraging a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled player statistics.

---

## Technical Details

Train a Semi-Supervised GAN where the Discriminator is a multi-class classifier that predicts both real/fake and player class. The Generator generates synthetic player statistics.

---

## Expected Impact

Improve player classification accuracy by leveraging unlabeled data, especially useful when labeled data is scarce.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 40 hours
