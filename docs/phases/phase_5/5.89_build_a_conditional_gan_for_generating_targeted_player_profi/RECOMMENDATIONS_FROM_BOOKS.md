## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 8
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Implement a Conditional GAN to generate synthetic player profiles with specific characteristics, such as player archetypes (e.g., sharpshooter, playmaker) or skill levels.

---

## Technical Details

Condition the Generator and Discriminator on the desired player characteristics. The Generator inputs noise and player characteristic labels and outputs player statistics. The discriminator is trained to discern between real and generated statistics, and also uses player characteristic labels as input to the training loop.

---

## Expected Impact

Generate synthetic player profiles for scouting, training simulations, and player development.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 40 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
