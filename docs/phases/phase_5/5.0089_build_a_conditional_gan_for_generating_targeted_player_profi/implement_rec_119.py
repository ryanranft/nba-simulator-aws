Implementation: Build a Conditional GAN for Generating Targeted Player Profiles

Recommendation ID: rec_119
Source: Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
Priority: IMPORTANT

Description:
Implement a Conditional GAN to generate synthetic player profiles with specific characteristics, such as player archetypes (e.g., sharpshooter, playmaker) or skill levels.

Expected Impact:
Generate synthetic player profiles for scouting, training simulations, and player development.
