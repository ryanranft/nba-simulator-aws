## Overview

### Purpose

Implement a Conditional GAN to generate synthetic player profiles with specific characteristics, such as player archetypes (e.g., sharpshooter, playmaker) or skill levels.

### Expected Outcomes

Generate synthetic player profiles for scouting, training simulations, and player development.

### Technical Approach

Condition the Generator and Discriminator on the desired player characteristics. The Generator inputs noise and player characteristic labels and outputs player statistics. The discriminator is trained to discern between real and generated statistics, and also uses player characteristic labels as input to the training loop.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```python
# Test individual components
import unittest
from implement_rec_119 import ImplementBuildAConditionalGanForGeneratingTargetedPlayerProfiles

class TestRec119(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_setup(self):
        impl = ImplementBuildAConditionalGanForGeneratingTargetedPlayerProfiles()
        result = impl.setup()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
    
    def test_execution(self):
        impl = ImplementBuildAConditionalGanForGeneratingTargetedPlayerProfiles()
        impl.setup()
        result = impl.execute()
        self.assertTrue(result['success'])
```
