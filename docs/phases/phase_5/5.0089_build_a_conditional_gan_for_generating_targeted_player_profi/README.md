# 5.89: Build a Conditional GAN for Generating Targeted Player Profiles

**Sub-Phase:** 5.89 (ML)
**Parent Phase:** [Phase 5: Machine Learning](../PHASE_5_INDEX.md)
**Status:** ðŸ”µ PLANNED
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT
**Implementation ID:** rec_119

---

## Overview

Implement a Conditional GAN to generate synthetic player profiles with specific characteristics, such as player archetypes (e.g., sharpshooter, playmaker) or skill levels.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Condition the Generator and Discriminator on the desired player characteristics
- The Generator inputs noise and player characteristic labels and outputs player statistics
- The discriminator is trained to discern between real and generated statistics, and also uses player characteristic labels as input to the training loop.

**Impact:**
Generate synthetic player profiles for scouting, training simulations, and player development.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from implement_rec_119 import ImplementBuildAConditionalGanForGeneratingTargetedPlayerProfiles

# Initialize implementation
impl = ImplementBuildAConditionalGanForGeneratingTargetedPlayerProfiles()
impl.setup()

# Execute implementation
results = impl.execute()

print(f"Implementation complete: {results}")
```

## Architecture

### Implementation Steps

1. Step 1: Define a set of player characteristics to be used as conditioning labels.
2. Step 2: Implement a Conditional GAN with conditioning labels for both Generator and Discriminator.
3. Step 3: Train the Conditional GAN to generate player profiles with the desired characteristics.
4. Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the generated player profiles by measuring their statistical properties and comparing them to real player profiles.
