## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Chapter 2: Regression Models
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Develop a predictive model to forecast player injuries based on workload, historical injury data, and player biometrics. Focus on parameters such as learning rate and subsample to mitigate overfitting.

---

## Technical Details

Employ `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` or similar libraries. Feature engineering includes player workload (minutes played, distance covered), historical injury data, biometric data (height, weight, age), and sleep data if available.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduces injury risk, optimizes player workload, and improves player availability.

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 32 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
