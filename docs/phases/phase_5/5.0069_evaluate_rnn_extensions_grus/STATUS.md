# Recommendation Status: Evaluate RNN Extensions: GRUs

**ID:** rec_099
**Name:** Evaluate RNN Extensions: GRUs
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** Generative Deep Learning
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

In many sequence-modeling tasks, use GRUs instead of LSTMs. GRUs are computationally less expensive and have been shown to outperform LSTMs in many applications. Implement, train, and compare to existing LSTM models.

---

## Expected Impact

Increased training efficiency, higher performance, or decreased complexity for sequence data modeling.
