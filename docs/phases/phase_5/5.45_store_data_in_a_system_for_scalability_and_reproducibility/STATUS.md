# Recommendation Status: Store Data in a System for Scalability and Reproducibility

**ID:** rec_070
**Name:** Store Data in a System for Scalability and Reproducibility
**Phase:** 5 (Architecture)
**Source Books:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 40 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Scale the storage and training of data by moving to a reliable system with version control, and a process for managing dependencies so that processes can be easily reproduced, allowing the models to be more easily debugged.

---

## Expected Impact

Optimized the storage of data at scale and increased the reproducibility of the results.
