## Recommendation Details

Operationalize a trained model to predict outcomes by wrapping with Flask and JSON. Also implement API to return model's probabilities of success.

---

## Technical Details

The Python program should create a JSON endpoint using Flask that takes the name, opponent name, and location as a request and responds with a JSON document indicating the probability of winning.

---

## Expected Impact

Enables easy use of the model in external systems and programs.
