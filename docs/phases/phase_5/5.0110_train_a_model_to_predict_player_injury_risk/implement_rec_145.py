Implementation: Train a Model to Predict Player Injury Risk

Recommendation ID: rec_145
Source: building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
Priority: IMPORTANT

Description:
Train a model that estimates the likelihood of specific injuries to players based on factors such as medical history, training regiments, and game logs.

Expected Impact:
Minimizing player injury risk while maximizing play time.
