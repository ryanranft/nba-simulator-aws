# 5.110: Train a Model to Predict Player Injury Risk

**Sub-Phase:** 5.110 (ML)
**Parent Phase:** [Phase 5: Machine Learning](../PHASE_5_INDEX.md)
**Status:** ðŸ”µ PLANNED
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT
**Implementation ID:** rec_145

---

## Overview

Train a model that estimates the likelihood of specific injuries to players based on factors such as medical history, training regiments, and game logs.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Consolidate diverse data for players into one pipeline
- Train classification models or survival analysis models using the output as the label.

**Impact:**
Minimizing player injury risk while maximizing play time.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from implement_rec_145 import ImplementTrainAModelToPredictPlayerInjuryRisk

# Initialize implementation
impl = ImplementTrainAModelToPredictPlayerInjuryRisk()
impl.setup()

# Execute implementation
results = impl.execute()

print(f"Implementation complete: {results}")
```

---

## Architecture

### Implementation Steps

1. Step 1: Build a robust data processing pipeline that consolidates all existing sources of information into one data lake.
2. Step 2: Establish a formal definition for player injuries and use it to label players in the dataset.
3. Step 3: Train a classification or survival analysis model and track it through time.
