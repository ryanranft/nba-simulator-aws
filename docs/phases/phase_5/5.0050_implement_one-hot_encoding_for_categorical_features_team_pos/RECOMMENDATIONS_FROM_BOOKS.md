## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Chapter 3: Classification Models
**Category:** Data Processing

---

## Recommendation Details

Convert categorical features such as team affiliation and player position into numerical data suitable for machine learning models using one-hot encoding. This prevents models from assigning ordinal relationships to unordered categories.

---

## Technical Details

Utilize `pandas.get_dummies` or `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`. Generate a new column for each unique value in the categorical feature, with 1 indicating the presence of that value and 0 indicating its absence.

---

## Expected Impact

Ensures that categorical variables are correctly represented in machine learning models, improving model accuracy and interpretability.

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours
