Implementation: Incorporate Team Salaries as a Covariate in the Model

Recommendation ID: rec_157
Source: Econometrics versus the Bookmakers An econometric approach to sports betting
Priority: IMPORTANT

Description:
Integrate NBA team salary data into the extended Bradley-Terry model as a covariate.  Explore both linear and logarithmic forms of salary data to determine the best fit.  Handle potential data availability issues by projecting salaries based on historical trends.

Expected Impact:
Potentially improve model accuracy by incorporating a key factor influencing team performance. The book suggests a high correlation between salaries and performance in football.
