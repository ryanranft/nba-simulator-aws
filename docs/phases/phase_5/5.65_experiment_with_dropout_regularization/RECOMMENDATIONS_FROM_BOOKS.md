## Recommendation Details

Add dropout layers to reduce overfitting, especially after dense layers. Experiment with different dropout rates (e.g., 0.25, 0.5).

---

## Technical Details

Insert Dropout layers after Dense layers in existing models.  Evaluate alongside and against batch normalization.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduced overfitting and better generalization performance, especially for models with many parameters.
