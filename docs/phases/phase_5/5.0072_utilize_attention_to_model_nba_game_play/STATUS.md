## Description

The ability of a transformer model to perform long-range sequence predictions is useful in any case where long term behavior is expected. Utilize this mechanism to predict passes between players, scores, and other relevant aspects of an NBA game.

---

## Expected Impact

Increased performance for modeling complex, sequential behaviors with long-range relationships. High-level dependencies may have more reliable attention vectors.
