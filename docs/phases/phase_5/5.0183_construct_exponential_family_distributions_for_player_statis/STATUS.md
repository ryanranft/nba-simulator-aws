# Recommendation Status: Construct Exponential Family Distributions for Player Statistics Modeling

**ID:** rec_024
**Name:** Construct Exponential Family Distributions for Player Statistics Modeling
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** STATISTICS 601 Advanced Statistical Methods ( PDFDrive )
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 16 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

## Description

Model player statistics (e.g., points scored, rebounds) using exponential family distributions, leveraging their well-defined properties for statistical inference. Select appropriate distributions based on the nature of the data (e.g., Poisson for counts, Gamma for positive continuous values).

---

## Expected Impact

Provides a robust framework for modeling player statistics and enables efficient parameter estimation and inference.
