Implementation: Develop a Binary Classification Model for Predicting Player Success

Recommendation ID: rec_073
Source: Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
Priority: IMPORTANT

Description:
Build a classification model to predict whether a prospect player will be successful in the NBA based on pre-draft data (college statistics, scouting reports). Define success as a player achieving a certain number of years played or reaching a specific performance threshold.

Expected Impact:
Enhances draft pick decisions, improves prospect evaluation, and minimizes scouting errors.
