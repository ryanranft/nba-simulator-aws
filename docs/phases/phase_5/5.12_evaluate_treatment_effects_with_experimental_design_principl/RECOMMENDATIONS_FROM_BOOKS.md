## Recommendation Details

Apply experimental design principles like randomized treatment assignment to test different lineup combinations in simulated NBA games. This allows for quantification of the impact of lineup changes on performance metrics.

---

## Technical Details

Randomly assign player combinations to 'treatment' groups.  Use simulation to evaluate the mean difference in key statistics (e.g., points scored, assists, rebounds) between treatment groups.

---

## Expected Impact

Data-driven decisions on lineup optimization and player substitutions, potentially leading to increased team performance.
