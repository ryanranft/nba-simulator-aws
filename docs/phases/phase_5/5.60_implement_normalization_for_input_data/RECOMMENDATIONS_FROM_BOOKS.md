## Source Information

**Book:** Generative Deep Learning
**Chapter:** Chapter 2: Deep Learning
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Normalize input data (player stats, game data) before feeding into deep learning models to improve training stability and convergence.

---

## Technical Details

Use techniques like StandardScaler (mean 0, standard deviation 1) or MinMaxScaler (scaling to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]) from scikit-learn.

---

## Expected Impact

Improved training stability, faster convergence, and potentially better model performance by preventing features with large values from dominating the learning process.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 8 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
