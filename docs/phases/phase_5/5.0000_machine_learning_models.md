# Phase 5: Machine Learning Infrastructure (SageMaker)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 & 3 complete (RDS populated with 6.7M plays)
**Estimated Time:** 6-12 hours
**Actual Time:** 4 hours
**Estimated Cost:** $7-75/month (usage-dependent)
**Actual Cost:** $0/month (notebook stopped when not in use)
**Started:** October 3, 2025
**Completed:** October 3, 2025

---

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT - Before Starting This Phase:**
>
> **Ask Claude:** "Should I add any workflows to this phase before beginning?"
>
> This allows Claude to review the current workflow references and recommend any missing workflows that would improve implementation guidance. Phases 1-3 were enhanced with comprehensive workflow instructions - this phase should receive the same treatment before starting work.

---

## Overview

Set up AWS SageMaker for machine learning model development and training. Use historical NBA data to build predictive models for game outcomes, player performance, and playoff predictions.

**⚠️ Temporal Enhancement Opportunity:**
This phase can be significantly enhanced with temporal feature engineering once Phase 3.5 (Temporal Database Schema) is complete. Temporal features enable time-aware ML models that account for player aging, fatigue, momentum, and precise game context.

**This phase includes:**
- SageMaker Notebook instance for development
- SageMaker Training jobs for model training
- Feature engineering pipelines (traditional + temporal)
- Model deployment (optional)
- **(Future)** Temporal feature engineering with millisecond precision

| (40 hrs/month) | 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM | $2.32 | $0.058/hr × 40 hrs |
| (100 hrs/month) | 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM | $5.80 | $0.058/hr × 100 hrs |
| | | | |
| **Training Jobs** | ml.m5.xlarge | $5-50 | Varies by experimentation |
| (10 jobs × 30 min) | 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM | $1.35 | $0.269/hr × 5 hrs |

| **Total (Heavy Use)** | | **~$65/month** | Intensive development |

**Recommendation:** Start with light use ($7-10/month), scale as needed

---

## Instance Management

**SageMaker Notebook:**
```bash
# Stop when not in use
aws sagemaker stop-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name nba-ml-notebook

# Start when needed
aws sagemaker start-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name nba-ml-notebook

# Check status
aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name nba-ml-notebook
```

**Cost optimization:**
- Stop notebook when not actively developing
- Use Spot instances for training (70% discount, may be interrupted)
- Store only essential data in S3 (delete intermediate files)

---

## ML Workflows

**Typical development cycle:**

1. **Feature engineering** (in notebook):
   - Query RDS for raw data
   - Transform and create features
   - Save to S3 as Parquet

2. **Model prototyping** (in notebook):
   - Load features from S3
   - Train models locally
   - Evaluate performance

3. **Production training** (SageMaker job):
   - Scale to full dataset
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Save best model

4. **Model deployment** (optional):
   - Create SageMaker endpoint
   - Real-time predictions

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

1. **Notebook won't start**
   - Check IAM role has SageMaker permissions
   - Verify VPC/subnet configuration
   - Check service quotas (default: 2 instances)

2. **Can't connect to RDS from notebook**
   - RDS security group must allow SageMaker security group
   - Or allow VPC CIDR range
   - See workflow #32 for connection troubleshooting

3. **Training job fails**
   - Check training script for errors
   - Verify S3 paths are correct
   - Review CloudWatch logs for details

4. **Out of memory**
   - Use larger instance type (ml.m5.2xlarge)
   - Or reduce batch size in training script
   - Or sample data for development

## Sub-Phase 5.0005: Temporal Feature Engineering (FUTURE ENHANCEMENT)

**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Prerequisites:** Phase 3.5 complete (Temporal Database Schema), Sub-Phases 5.1-5.4 complete
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks
**Estimated Cost:** No additional cost (uses existing SageMaker notebook)

### Overview

Enhance ML models with temporal features that capture time-dependent effects like player aging, fatigue, momentum, clutch performance, and game context at exact timestamps. Traditional features are static (season averages); temporal features are dynamic (performance at exact moment).

**Traditional ML features:**
- Player season averages (PPG, FG%, etc.)
- Team season statistics
- Home/away indicator
- Days rest (team-level)

**Temporal ML features:**
- Player age at exact game timestamp (37.8145 years, not just "37")
- Player fatigue level (minutes played, rest since last substitution)
- Team momentum (scoring run in last 5 minutes)
- Player clutch factor (performance in close games, final 5 minutes)
- Career trajectory (improving/declining based on temporal trends)
- Opponent-adjusted performance at timestamp

### Temporal Feature Categories

#### 1. Player Age Features

**Precise Age Calculation:**
```python
def get_age_features(player_id, game_timestamp):
    """
    Calculate precise player age and age-related features.
    """
    birth_date = get_player_birth_date(player_id)

    # Precise age in years with decimal
    age_years = calculate_player_age(player_id, game_timestamp)

    # Age-related features
    features = {
        'age_years': age_years,
        'age_squared': age_years ** 2,  # Quadratic age effect
        'years_from_peak': abs(age_years - 27.5),  # Distance from peak (27-28)
        'is_rookie': 1 if age_years < 20 else 0,
        'is_prime': 1 if 25 <= age_years <= 30 else 0,
        'is_veteran': 1 if age_years > 32 else 0,
        'career_stage': categorize_career_stage(age_years),  # Early/Prime/Decline
    }

    return features

# Example: Kobe at June 19, 2016, 7:02:34 PM
# age_years = 37.8145
# years_from_peak = 10.3145 (well past prime)
# career_stage = 'Decline'
```

#### 2. Fatigue Features

**Real-Time Fatigue Tracking:**
```python
def get_fatigue_features(player_id, game_timestamp, game_start):
    """
    Calculate fatigue-related features during game.
    """
    # Minutes played so far this game
    minutes_played = get_player_minutes_at_time(player_id, game_timestamp)

    # Time since last substitution
    last_sub_time = get_last_substitution_time(player_id, game_timestamp)
    consecutive_minutes = (game_timestamp - last_sub_time).total_seconds() / 60.0

    # Recent game history
    games_in_last_7_days = count_games_in_window(player_id, game_timestamp, days=7)
    rest_days = get_rest_days_since_last_game(player_id, game_timestamp)

    features = {
        'minutes_played': minutes_played,
        'minutes_squared': minutes_played ** 2,  # Non-linear fatigue effect
        'consecutive_minutes': consecutive_minutes,
        'is_fatigued': 1 if minutes_played > 35 else 0,
        'games_in_7_days': games_in_last_7_days,
        'rest_days': rest_days,
        'is_back_to_back': 1 if rest_days == 0 else 0,
        'fatigue_score': calculate_composite_fatigue(minutes_played, consecutive_minutes, rest_days),
    }

    return features

# Example: Player at 35 minutes, 8 consecutive minutes, 1 day rest
# fatigue_score = 0.72 (28% fatigue penalty)
# is_fatigued = 1
```

#### 3. Momentum Features

**Team and Player Momentum:**
```python
def get_momentum_features(player_id, team_id, game_timestamp):
    """
    Calculate momentum-related features (recent performance).
    """
    lookback_seconds = 300  # Last 5 minutes

    # Team momentum
    team_events = get_team_events_in_window(team_id, game_timestamp, lookback_seconds)

### Validation Metrics

- [ ] Temporal features extracted for 100% of training data
- [ ] Feature quality checks pass (no nulls, reasonable ranges)
- [ ] Model accuracy improves by 5%+ with temporal features
- [ ] Feature importance analysis shows temporal features in top 10
- [ ] Cross-validation confirms improvements hold on test data
- [ ] Prediction latency remains < 100ms per prediction

### Cost Impact

**No additional infrastructure cost:**
- Uses existing SageMaker notebook ($8.95/month)
- Feature storage in S3 negligible (< 1 GB)
- Training time increases ~30% (more features)

**Performance:**
- Feature extraction: ~50ms per player-game
- Model training: ~10-15 min for 43K games (vs. 8 min baseline)
- Inference: ~5ms per prediction (vs. 3ms baseline)
