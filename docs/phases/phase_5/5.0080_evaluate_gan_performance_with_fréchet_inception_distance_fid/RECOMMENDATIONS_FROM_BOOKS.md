## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 5
**Category:** Statistics

---

## Recommendation Details

Implement FID as a primary metric for evaluating the quality of generated data, providing a more reliable assessment compared to relying solely on visual inspection.

---

## Technical Details

Calculate the Fréchet distance between the Inception network activations of real and generated data distributions. Requires pre-trained Inception network. Lower FID score indicates better quality.

---

## Expected Impact

Enable objective comparison of different GAN architectures and training parameters, leading to improved generated data quality.
