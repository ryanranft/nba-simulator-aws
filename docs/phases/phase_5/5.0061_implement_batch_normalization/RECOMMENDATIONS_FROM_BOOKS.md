## Recommendation Details

Add batch normalization layers after dense or convolutional layers to reduce internal covariate shift and improve training stability.  Consider using it *instead* of Dropout.

---

## Technical Details

Insert BatchNormalization layers after activation functions in existing models. Tune the `momentum` parameter.

---

## Expected Impact

Improved training stability, faster convergence, higher learning rates, and potentially better generalization performance.
