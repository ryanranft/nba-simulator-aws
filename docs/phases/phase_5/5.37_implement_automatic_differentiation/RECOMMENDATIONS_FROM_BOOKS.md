## Recommendation Details

Use automatic differentiation (backpropagation) to efficiently compute gradients for complex, non-linear models, such as those used in deep reinforcement learning for strategy optimization.

---

## Technical Details

Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement automatic differentiation. Define the model as a computation graph, and let the framework automatically compute gradients using reverse-mode differentiation.

---

## Expected Impact

Enables training of complex models with high-dimensional parameter spaces, improving the accuracy and sophistication of predictive models.
