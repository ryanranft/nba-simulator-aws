## Source Information

**Book:** Hands On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
**Chapter:** Chapter 2
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Leverage Encoder models (i.e. BERT, DistilBERT) to better understand different facets of language.

---

## Technical Details

Encoder models output contextualized embeddings that capture the meaning of an input. By adding a small network on top of these embeddings, one can train for semantic information.

---

## Expected Impact

The rich semantic understanding will allow easier use cases, such as sentiment detection, text similarity, and other use cases.

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 40 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
