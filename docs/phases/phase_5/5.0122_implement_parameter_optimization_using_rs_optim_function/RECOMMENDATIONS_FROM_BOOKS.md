## Source Information

**Book:** Econometrics versus the Bookmakers An econometric approach to sports betting
**Chapter:** 4.3 Modelling the data in R
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Utilize R's 'optim' function with the Nelder-Mead method to find the coefficients that best fit the extended Bradley-Terry model. Optimize the model by minimizing the negative sum of the probabilities.

---

## Technical Details

R programming, optim function, Nelder-Mead method, log-likelihood function, negative sum of probabilities.

---

## Expected Impact

Improved model accuracy by finding the optimal parameter settings.
