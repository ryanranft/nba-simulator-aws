## Recommendation Details

Represent NBA player statistics (e.g., points, rebounds, assists) and team performance metrics as vectors in Rn. This allows for the application of linear algebra and analytic geometry techniques.

---

## Technical Details

Use NumPy arrays in Python or similar vector/matrix libraries to represent the data. Map categorical features (e.g., player position) to numerical representations using one-hot encoding or embedding layers.

---

## Expected Impact

Enables the application of linear algebra and analytic geometry methods for player similarity analysis, team performance modeling, and game simulation.
