## Recommendation Details

World Models allow one to pre-generate environments before training takes place, allowing the reinforcement learning to occur extremely quickly.

---

## Technical Details

Set up a reinforcement learning system and have the generator start building environments before the training step to ensure that the training step is as efficient as possible.

---

## Expected Impact

Increased responsiveness to the training environment. Agents learn and operate faster.
