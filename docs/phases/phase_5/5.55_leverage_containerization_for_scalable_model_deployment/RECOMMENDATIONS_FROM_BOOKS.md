## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Chapter 7: Operationalizing Machine Learning Models
**Category:** Architecture

---

## Recommendation Details

Use Docker to create container images that encapsulate trained machine learning models and web services. Deploy container instances on cloud platforms (e.g., Azure Container Instances, AWS ECS) to ensure scalability and reproducibility.

---

## Technical Details

Create a Dockerfile with instructions to install dependencies, copy model files, and expose web service endpoints. Use `docker build` to create container images and `docker run` to launch instances.

---

## Expected Impact

Simplified model deployment, automated model scaling, and reduced operational overhead.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 12 hours

---

## Dependencies
