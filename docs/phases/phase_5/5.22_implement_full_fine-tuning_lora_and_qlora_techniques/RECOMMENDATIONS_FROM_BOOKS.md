## Recommendation Details

Fine-tune LLMs using full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA techniques to optimize model performance for NBA analytics tasks. This involves refining the modelâ€™s capabilities for targeted tasks or specialized domains.

---

## Technical Details

Implement full fine-tuning by retraining all model parameters. Implement LoRA by introducing trainable low-rank matrices. Implement QLoRA by quantizing model parameters to a lower precision.

---

## Expected Impact

Optimized model performance for targeted NBA analytics tasks, reduced memory usage during training, and enhanced model adaptation to specialized domains.
