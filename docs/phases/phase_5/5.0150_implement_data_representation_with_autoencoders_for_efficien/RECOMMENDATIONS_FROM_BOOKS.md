## Recommendation Details

Use autoencoders to compress NBA player statistics and game data into lower-dimensional representations. This allows for efficient feature extraction for downstream tasks like player performance prediction or game outcome forecasting. By training the autoencoder, the system learns essential features from the data and can use those representations for other tasks.

---

## Technical Details

Implement a convolutional autoencoder with an encoder and decoder component using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Train the autoencoder on NBA player statistics and game data. Evaluate the reconstruction loss to ensure that the decoder can accurately reconstruct the original data from the compressed representation.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduces the amount of data needed for processing, making training more efficient. Allows focus on key features improving prediction accuracy. Enables manipulation of latent representations for data augmentation or anomaly detection.
