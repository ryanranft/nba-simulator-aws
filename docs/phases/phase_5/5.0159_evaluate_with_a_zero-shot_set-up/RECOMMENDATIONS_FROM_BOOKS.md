## Source Information

**Book:** Hands On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
**Chapter:** Chapter 2
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Train a zero-shot model and test its ability to solve novel problems without further fine-tuning. The zero-shot application removes the need to train an entirely new mode by relying on existing training data.

---

## Technical Details

Test on a series of problems that weren't used in training. Make sure to have separate test and training datasets to prevent biases during the testing phase.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduces computational power required for new problems by enabling models to be re-used for novel challenges.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 20 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
