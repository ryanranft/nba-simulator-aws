"""
Implementation: Evaluate with a Zero-Shot Set-Up

Recommendation ID: rec_207
Source: Hands On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
Priority: IMPORTANT

Description:
Train a zero-shot model and test its ability to solve novel problems without further fine-tuning. The zero-shot application removes the need to train an entirely new mode by relying on existing training data.

Expected Impact:
Reduces computational power required for new problems by enabling models to be re-used for novel challenges.
