# Recommendation Status: Evaluate with a Zero-Shot Set-Up

**ID:** rec_207
**Name:** Evaluate with a Zero-Shot Set-Up
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** Hands On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 20 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Train a zero-shot model and test its ability to solve novel problems without further fine-tuning. The zero-shot application removes the need to train an entirely new mode by relying on existing training data.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduces computational power required for new problems by enabling models to be re-used for novel challenges.
