# 5.159: Evaluate with a Zero-Shot Set-Up

**Sub-Phase:** 5.159 (ML)
**Parent Phase:** [Phase 5: Machine Learning](../PHASE_5_INDEX.md)
**Status:** ðŸ”µ PLANNED
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT
**Implementation ID:** rec_207

---

## Overview

Train a zero-shot model and test its ability to solve novel problems without further fine-tuning. The zero-shot application removes the need to train an entirely new mode by relying on existing training data.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Test on a series of problems that weren't used in training
- Make sure to have separate test and training datasets to prevent biases during the testing phase.

**Impact:**
Reduces computational power required for new problems by enabling models to be re-used for novel challenges.

## Quick Start

```python
from implement_rec_207 import ImplementEvaluateWithAZeroshotSetup

# Initialize implementation
impl = ImplementEvaluateWithAZeroshotSetup()
impl.setup()

# Execute implementation
results = impl.execute()

print(f"Implementation complete: {results}")
```

---

## Architecture

### Implementation Steps

1. Step 1: Implement code to retrieve separate training and testing datasets.
2. Step 2: Pass a series of prompts and inputs to a model that was only trained with training data.
3. Step 3: Record metrics based on evaluation dataset and pass them to reporting tools.
