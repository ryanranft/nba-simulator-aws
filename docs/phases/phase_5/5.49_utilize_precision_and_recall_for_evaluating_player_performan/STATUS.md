## Description

In evaluating player performance classifiers (e.g., predicting All-Star status), emphasize the use of precision and recall metrics in addition to overall accuracy. This addresses the potential class imbalance and ensures a focus on identifying truly elite players.

---

## Expected Impact

Optimize the classification by balancing correctly labeled all-star players with misclassified non-all-star players
