## Recommendation Details

Employ attention mechanisms to improve the way models handle long sequences and learn long-range relationships. This approach enables the model to estimate the relevance of some tokens to other tokens.

---

## Technical Details

Transformers will leverage attention mechanisms to estimate how relevant some tokens are to others.

---

## Expected Impact

Increased accuracy with difficult, long-range relationships that models may otherwise miss.
