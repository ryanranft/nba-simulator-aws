## Recommendation Details

Implement dropout layers to prevent models from learning the training data too well in cases with a low diversity in the training data

---

## Technical Details

Apply dropout layers using the `tensorflow.keras.layers` library.

---

## Expected Impact

In the case of low diversity in the training data, dropout can prevent the model from overfitting
