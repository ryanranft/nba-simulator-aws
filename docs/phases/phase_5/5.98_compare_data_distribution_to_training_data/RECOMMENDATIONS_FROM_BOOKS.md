## Source Information

**Book:** building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
**Chapter:** Chapter 11

## Recommendation Details

To help estimate model performance, ensure that new input has data similar to the test data. Any significant drift from this data will likely make the model perform poorly.

---

## Technical Details

Collect a distribution of data values, then implement an alert if the current distribution is meaningfully different from that data

---

## Expected Impact

Provide more robust data flow.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 24 hours
