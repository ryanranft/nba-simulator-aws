# Recommendation Status: Utilize Object-Oriented Programming for Managing CycleGAN Complexity

**ID:** rec_124
**Name:** Utilize Object-Oriented Programming for Managing CycleGAN Complexity
**Phase:** 5 (Architecture)
**Source Books:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 10 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

CycleGANs are complex to construct and should be organized through object-oriented (OOP) programming with different methods to run functions of various components. By splitting various segments of code, the components become easier to manage.

---

## Expected Impact

Increase model flexibility and code reuse.
