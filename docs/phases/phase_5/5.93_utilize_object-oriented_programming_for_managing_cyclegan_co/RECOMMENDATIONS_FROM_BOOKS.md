## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 9
**Category:** Architecture

---

## Recommendation Details

CycleGANs are complex to construct and should be organized through object-oriented (OOP) programming with different methods to run functions of various components. By splitting various segments of code, the components become easier to manage.

---

## Technical Details

In OOP: 1) Create a high-level cycleGAN class that passes parameters related to a particular object (i.e., images for image classification). 2) Create methods for running each instance of a particular object and calling new objects or processes.

---

## Expected Impact

Increase model flexibility and code reuse.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 10 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
