## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 16 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Conduct a comprehensive analysis of residuals to assess the adequacy of models. Use various types of residuals (raw, studentized, deviance) and visualization techniques (histograms, scatterplots) to identify potential problems like non-constant variance, non-normality, or model misspecification.

---

## Expected Impact

Improved model validation and identification of areas for model refinement, leading to more reliable and accurate predictions.
