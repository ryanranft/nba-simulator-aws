## Recommendation Details

Conduct a comprehensive analysis of residuals to assess the adequacy of models. Use various types of residuals (raw, studentized, deviance) and visualization techniques (histograms, scatterplots) to identify potential problems like non-constant variance, non-normality, or model misspecification.

---

## Technical Details

Implement residual analysis using Python libraries like Statsmodels. Calculate and plot different types of residuals against fitted values, covariates, and time.

---

## Expected Impact

Improved model validation and identification of areas for model refinement, leading to more reliable and accurate predictions.

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 16 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
