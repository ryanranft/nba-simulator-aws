## Recommendation Details

Identify anomalous player performances (e.g., unexpectedly high or low scores) by applying PCA. Calculate reconstruction error for each game and flag games with errors exceeding a certain threshold.

---

## Technical Details

Use `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`. Train PCA on a dataset of typical player performances. Calculate reconstruction error (MSE) for each new game. Flag games with error higher than a threshold. Set alert based on anomaly detection.

## Expected Impact

Enables proactive detection of unusual performance deviations, identifying players at risk of injury or those who exceed expectations, providing valuable insights for team management.
