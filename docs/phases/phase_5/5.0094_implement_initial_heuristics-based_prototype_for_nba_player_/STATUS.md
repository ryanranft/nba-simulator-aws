# Recommendation Status: Implement Initial Heuristics-Based Prototype for NBA Player Performance Prediction

**ID:** rec_125
**Name:** Implement Initial Heuristics-Based Prototype for NBA Player Performance Prediction
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Before applying ML, create a rule-based system leveraging basketball domain knowledge to establish a baseline for predicting player performance metrics (e.g., points per game, assists). This allows for a quick MVP and a benchmark against which to measure future ML model improvements.

---

## Expected Impact

Establishes a clear baseline and defines initial hypotheses about what makes a successful player.
