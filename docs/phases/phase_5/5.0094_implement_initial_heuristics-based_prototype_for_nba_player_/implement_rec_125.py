Implementation: Implement Initial Heuristics-Based Prototype for NBA Player Performance Prediction

Recommendation ID: rec_125
Source: building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
Priority: CRITICAL

Description:
Before applying ML, create a rule-based system leveraging basketball domain knowledge to establish a baseline for predicting player performance metrics (e.g., points per game, assists). This allows for a quick MVP and a benchmark against which to measure future ML model improvements.

Expected Impact:
Establishes a clear baseline and defines initial hypotheses about what makes a successful player.
