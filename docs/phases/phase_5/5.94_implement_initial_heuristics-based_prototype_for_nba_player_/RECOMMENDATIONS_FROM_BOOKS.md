## Source Information

**Book:** building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
**Chapter:** Chapter 3
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Before applying ML, create a rule-based system leveraging basketball domain knowledge to establish a baseline for predicting player performance metrics (e.g., points per game, assists). This allows for a quick MVP and a benchmark against which to measure future ML model improvements.

---

## Technical Details

Utilize readily available NBA statistics and expert insights to define scoring rules. Use Python to code the rules and evaluate them on a sample dataset.

---

## Expected Impact

Establishes a clear baseline and defines initial hypotheses about what makes a successful player.
