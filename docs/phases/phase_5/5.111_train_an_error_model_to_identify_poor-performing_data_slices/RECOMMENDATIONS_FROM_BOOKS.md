## Recommendation Details

One tool that helps with creating better data pipelines for AI is to create 'error models' that model when a base model is likely to fail.

---

## Technical Details

Train a model to predict when an existing model produces errors. Use the predictions of this model to re-calibrate the main model.

---

## Expected Impact

Increases robustness in the model without high manual intervention.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 24 hours

---

## Dependencies
