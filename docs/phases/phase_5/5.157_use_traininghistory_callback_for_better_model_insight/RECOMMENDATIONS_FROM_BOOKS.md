## Recommendation Details

Leverage TrainingHistory callback in the TrainingArguments to automatically store and print loss, evaluation loss, and metrics in a csv file for every training step. This will improve overall visibility during the training process.

---

## Technical Details

The evaluate library is called with training metrics to quickly produce training step data to be used to better inspect models.

---

## Expected Impact

Better tracking of data and metrics during training and experimentation to facilitate better model iterations.
