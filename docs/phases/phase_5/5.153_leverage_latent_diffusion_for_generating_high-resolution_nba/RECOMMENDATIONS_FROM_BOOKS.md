## Recommendation Details

Apply latent diffusion techniques to generate high-resolution NBA action shots. This reduces the computational cost of generating high-resolution images by performing the diffusion process in the latent space and helps with video content generation.

---

## Technical Details

Implement a VAE to encode high-resolution NBA action shots into a lower-dimensional latent space. Train a diffusion model in the latent space. Decode the generated latents into high-resolution images. Evaluate the quality of generated images using visual inspection and metrics like FID.
