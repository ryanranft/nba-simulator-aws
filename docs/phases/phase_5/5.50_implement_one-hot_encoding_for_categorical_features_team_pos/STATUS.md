# Recommendation Status: Implement One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Features (Team, Position)

**ID:** rec_075
**Name:** Implement One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Features (Team, Position)
**Phase:** 5 (Data Processing)
**Source Books:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 6 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Convert categorical features such as team affiliation and player position into numerical data suitable for machine learning models using one-hot encoding. This prevents models from assigning ordinal relationships to unordered categories.

---

## Expected Impact

Ensures that categorical variables are correctly represented in machine learning models, improving model accuracy and interpretability.
