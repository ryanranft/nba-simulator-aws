## Source Information

**Book:** building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
**Chapter:** Chapter 2
**Category:** Testing

## Recommendation Details

Create a simple baseline model (e.g., logistic regression) to establish a performance floor and regularly evaluate the performance of new models against this baseline to prevent performance regressions.

---

## Technical Details

Train a logistic regression model on the same data as more complex models. Use accuracy, precision, and recall to compare performance against the baseline.

---

## Expected Impact

Prevent performance regressions and ensure that new models provide incremental improvements.
