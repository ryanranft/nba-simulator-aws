**ID:** rec_128
**Name:** Establish a Baseline Model and Regularly Evaluate Performance
**Phase:** 5 (Testing)
**Source Books:** building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Create a simple baseline model (e.g., logistic regression) to establish a performance floor and regularly evaluate the performance of new models against this baseline to prevent performance regressions.

---

## Expected Impact

Prevent performance regressions and ensure that new models provide incremental improvements.
