## Source Information

**Book:** Econometrics versus the Bookmakers An econometric approach to sports betting
**Chapter:** 5 Results
**Category:** Testing

---

## Recommendation Details

Instead of a single backtest over the entire season, implement a rolling window backtesting approach. Train the model on a subset of the data and test on the subsequent period, then roll the window forward. This simulates real-world model retraining.

---

## Technical Details

Time series data handling, model retraining, performance evaluation.

---

## Expected Impact

More realistic assessment of model performance and identification of potential overfitting.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 48 hours

---

## Dependencies

**Required Prerequisites:**

- Backtest and Validate Model Performance
- Automate the Model Fitting Process
