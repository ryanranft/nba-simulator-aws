# Recommendation Status: Implement a GAN for Simulating Player Movement Trajectories

**ID:** rec_112
**Name:** Implement a GAN for Simulating Player Movement Trajectories
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 40 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Use a GAN to generate realistic player movement trajectories.  The generator would learn to create plausible paths based on real game data, and the discriminator would distinguish between real and synthetic trajectories.

---

## Expected Impact

Generate data for training reinforcement learning models, simulating different game scenarios, and creating visually appealing game visualizations.
