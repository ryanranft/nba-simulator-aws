## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 11
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Oversample minority class instances in the image data by augmenting data using a DCGAN. This will lead to the development of a more stable classifier.

---

## Technical Details

First, build a DCGAN architecture. Second, create the data augmentation pipeline. The DCGAN should be run through a normal epoch run using the image datasets. The output of this will be a modified dataset and a DCGAN image generator object.

---

## Expected Impact

Improve the reliability of classification datasets for computer vision.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 40 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
