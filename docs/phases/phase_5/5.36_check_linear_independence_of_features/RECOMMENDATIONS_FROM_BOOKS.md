# Book Recommendations - rec_059

**Recommendation:** Check Linear Independence of Features
**Source Book:** ML Math
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Added:** 2025-10-19

---

## Source Information

**Book:** ML Math
**Chapter:** Chapter 2.5
**Category:** Statistics

---

## Recommendation Details

Check linear independence of features to avoid multicollinearity issues in regression models. Use Gaussian elimination to check for linear dependencies among columns in the feature matrix.

---

## Technical Details

Implement Gaussian elimination using NumPy. Columns that are not pivot columns can be expressed as linear combinations of columns to their left indicating linear dependence.

---

## Expected Impact

Avoids issues of multi-collinearity.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 8 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
