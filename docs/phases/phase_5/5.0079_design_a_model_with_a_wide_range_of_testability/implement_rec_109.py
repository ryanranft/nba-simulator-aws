"""
Implementation: Design a model with a wide range of testability

Recommendation ID: rec_109
Source: Generative Deep Learning
Priority: IMPORTANT

Description:
When designing a Generative AI project, ensure there are appropriate ways of testing, tracing errors, and checking against malicious or inappropriate prompts. This is helpful when developing new architectures, so models that allow inspection are very useful. Implement in both the core models and on the public-facing systems.

Expected Impact:
Reductions in errors, and increased understanding of model performance with high value on public acceptance.
