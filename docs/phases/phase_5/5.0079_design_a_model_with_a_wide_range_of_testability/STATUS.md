# Recommendation Status: Design a model with a wide range of testability

**ID:** rec_109
**Name:** Design a model with a wide range of testability
**Phase:** 5 (Security)
**Source Books:** Generative Deep Learning
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 16 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

When designing a Generative AI project, ensure there are appropriate ways of testing, tracing errors, and checking against malicious or inappropriate prompts. This is helpful when developing new architectures, so models that allow inspection are very useful. Implement in both the core models and on the public-facing systems.

---

## Expected Impact

Reductions in errors, and increased understanding of model performance with high value on public acceptance.
