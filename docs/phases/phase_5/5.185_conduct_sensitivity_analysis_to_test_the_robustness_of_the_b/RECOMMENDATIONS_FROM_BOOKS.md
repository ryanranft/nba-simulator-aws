## Recommendation Details

Analyze the dependence of posteriors and summary results (point estimates and intervals) on a range of prior choices.  This improves the robustness and reliability of Bayesian inference in NBA analytics, since no prior is 'perfect'.

---

## Technical Details

Define a set of plausible prior distributions that are substantially different. Re-run the same Bayesian inference pipeline multiple times. Quantify the dependence of posteriors on the prior.

---

## Expected Impact

Robustness in Bayesian inference. Identifying priors that are more informative, and documenting the dependence on less robust, informative priors.
