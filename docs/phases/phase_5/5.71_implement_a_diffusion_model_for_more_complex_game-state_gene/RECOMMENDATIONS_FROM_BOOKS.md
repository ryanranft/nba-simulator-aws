## Source Information

**Book:** Generative Deep Learning
**Chapter:** Chapter 8: Diffusion Models
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Generate image-based game state output using a diffusion model. Doing so will give a model that has been demonstrated to generate extremely high-quality images.

---

## Technical Details

Use a U-Net denoiser to build the core diffusion model. Implement the model by looking at existing Keras implementations.

---

## Expected Impact

Extremely high-resolution state output for more realistic game simulation models.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 32 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
