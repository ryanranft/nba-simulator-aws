# Recommendation Status: Experiment with Different Noise Schedules in Diffusion Models for NBA game generation

**ID:** rec_200
**Name:** Experiment with Different Noise Schedules in Diffusion Models for NBA game generation
**Phase:** 5 (ML)
**Source Books:** Hands On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 30 hours
**Dependencies:** 1 dependencies

---

## Description

Implement and test different noise schedules (linear, cosine, etc.) in the diffusion models. Different noise schedules significantly affect the performance of generating images. The optimal noise schedule may vary based on the dataset characteristics and computational resources.

---

## Expected Impact

Optimize noise schedule with a good balance between noise and image details.
