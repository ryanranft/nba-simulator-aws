# Recommendation Status: Conduct Sensitivity Analysis to Test the Robustness of the Bayesian Model to the Prior

**ID:** rec_027
**Name:** Conduct Sensitivity Analysis to Test the Robustness of the Bayesian Model to the Prior
**Phase:** 5 (Statistics)
**Source Books:** STATISTICS 601 Advanced Statistical Methods ( PDFDrive )
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Analyze the dependence of posteriors and summary results (point estimates and intervals) on a range of prior choices.  This improves the robustness and reliability of Bayesian inference in NBA analytics, since no prior is 'perfect'.

---

## Expected Impact

Robustness in Bayesian inference. Identifying priors that are more informative, and documenting the dependence on less robust, informative priors.
