## Source Information

**Book:** Hands On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
**Chapter:** Chapter 7
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Utilize Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune specialized video generation models, such as models to render different players, play styles, and other details. The LoRA files can be applied at inference time to the generated model.

---

## Technical Details

Implement LoRA, which adds adapters and greatly reduces the total number of parameters to be trained.

---

## Expected Impact

Faster, lighter image generation by only sending lighter adapter models.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 30 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
