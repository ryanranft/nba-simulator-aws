## Recommendation Details

When iterative algorithms are used for estimation or numerical computations, ensure that the chosen approach gives stable results irrespective of the starting values.

---

## Technical Details

Choose various sets of starting values (which depend on the number of parameters). Calculate the results by passing all of these starting points to the algorithm.

---

## Expected Impact

Verify that maximum likelihood and iterative algorithms in the project don't change simply due to a difference in starting values.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 8 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
