## Source Information

**Book:** Hands On Large Language Models
**Chapter:** Chapter 2. Tokens and Embeddings
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Use the tokenizer to convert the raw text into tokens and feed the embedding vectors into the Large Language Model. The output is then passed through the language model to generate contextual embeddings.

---

## Technical Details

Use the embeddings outputted from the tokenizer and pass it to DeBERTaV3 or other high performing LLM

---

## Expected Impact

Enable better handling of context

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

---

## Dependencies

**Required Prerequisites:**

- Implement Subword Tokenization
