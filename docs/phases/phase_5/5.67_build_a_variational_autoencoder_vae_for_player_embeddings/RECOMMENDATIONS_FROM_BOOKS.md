## Recommendation Details

Train a VAE to create player embeddings based on their stats and performance data. Use the latent space to generate new player profiles or analyze player similarities.

---

## Technical Details

Design encoder and decoder networks using Dense layers. Define a custom loss function including reconstruction loss and KL divergence.  Experiment with dimensionality of latent space. Use for downstream clustering and classification tasks.

---

## Expected Impact

Create meaningful player embeddings, discover player archetypes, and generate synthetic player data for simulations.
