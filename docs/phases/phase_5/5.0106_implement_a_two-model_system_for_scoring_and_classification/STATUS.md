# Recommendation Status: Implement a Two-Model System for Scoring and Classification

**ID:** rec_141
**Name:** Implement a Two-Model System for Scoring and Classification
**Phase:** 5 (Architecture)
**Source Books:** building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 16 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

To allow fine-tuning of system decisions, separate the system in two parts: a model dedicated to generating a score and a distinct system for translating scores to actions (e.g. reject/approve, surface/don't surface). This allows experimentation with both parts independently.

## Expected Impact

More flexibility to run and assess different business decisions
