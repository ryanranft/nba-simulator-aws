## Source Information

**Book:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Chapter:** Chapter 5
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Improve training stability of Wasserstein GAN by adding a gradient penalty term to the discriminator loss.

---

## Technical Details

Compute the gradient norm of the discriminator output with respect to its input. Add a penalty term to the discriminator loss that penalizes deviations of the gradient norm from 1.

---

## Expected Impact

Stabilize WGAN training, reduce mode collapse, and improve the quality of generated samples.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 12 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
