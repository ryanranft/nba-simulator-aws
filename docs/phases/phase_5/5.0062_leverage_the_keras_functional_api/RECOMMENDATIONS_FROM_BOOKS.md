## Source Information

**Book:** Generative Deep Learning
**Chapter:** Chapter 2: Deep Learning
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Utilize the Keras Functional API to build flexible and complex models with branching, multiple inputs, and multiple outputs. This will allow for more advanced architectures such as generative models.

---

## Technical Details

Rewrite existing Sequential models using the Functional API. Define input layers, connect layers by calling them on previous layers, and create a Model object with the input and output layers.

---

## Expected Impact

Greater flexibility in model design, enabling more complex architectures and easier experimentation with different layer connections.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 16 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
