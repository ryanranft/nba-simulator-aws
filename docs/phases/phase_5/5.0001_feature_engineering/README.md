## Overview

Comprehensive feature engineering system that transforms raw NBA game statistics into 50-100+ advanced features for machine learning models. Enables temporal pattern recognition, contextual analysis, and advanced efficiency metrics.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Temporal features (lags, rolling windows, trends)
- Cumulative statistics (career totals, season-to-date)
- Interaction features (home/away, rest effects)
- Contextual features (opponent strength, travel, altitude)
- Derived metrics (True Shooting %, PER, usage rate)
- Automated feature selection (variance and correlation filtering)

**Impact:**
- Model accuracy improvement: 63% → 68-71% (+5-8% absolute)
- Feature expansion: 25-30 raw stats → 80-100 engineered features
- Enables temporal pattern recognition and contextual awareness

## Quick Start

```python
from implement_rec_11 import AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline
import pandas as pd

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()
pipeline.setup()  # Loads rec_22 panel data system

# Load your player-game data
df = pd.read_parquet('player_games.parquet')

# Execute full pipeline
results = pipeline.execute(demo_data=df)

# Extract engineered features
features_df = results['engineered_df']
feature_names = results['selected_feature_names']

print(f"Generated {len(feature_names)} features")
```

## Architecture

### Pipeline Components

**1. Temporal Features** (`generate_temporal_features()`)
- Lag features: Previous 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 games
- Rolling windows: Last 3, 5, 10, 20 game averages and standard deviations
- Trend analysis: Improvement/decline indicators over 5 and 10 game windows
- Examples: `points_lag1`, `fg_pct_rolling_10_mean`, `assists_trend_5`

**2. Cumulative Features** (`generate_cumulative_features()`)
- Career totals: Accumulating statistics from career start
- Season-to-date: Running totals within current season
- Per-game averages: Career averages calculated on-the-fly
- Examples: `points_cumulative`, `games_cumulative`, `rebounds_career_avg`

**3. Interaction Features** (`generate_interaction_features()`)
- Home/Away splits: Performance by venue
- Rest interactions: Back-to-back vs rested performance
- Season fatigue: Performance by season quarter
- Examples: `points_home_avg`, `minutes_by_rest`, `points_by_season_quarter`

**4. Contextual Features** (`generate_contextual_features()`)
- Schedule strength: Opponent win percentage
- Travel burden: Cumulative travel distance over 7-game windows
- Back-to-back streaks: Frequency of consecutive B2B games
- Altitude effects: Performance at high-altitude venues
- Examples: `opponent_strength_l5`, `travel_burden_l7`, `points_at_altitude`

**5. Derived Features** (`generate_derived_features()`)
- True Shooting %: Comprehensive shooting efficiency
- Usage Rate: Possession usage percentage
- Assist Ratio: Playmaking efficiency
- Per-36 stats: Normalized per-36-minute statistics
- Player Efficiency Rating (PER): Simplified version
- Examples: `ts_pct`, `usage_rate`, `points_per_36`, `per`

**6. Engineered Features** (`generate_engineered_features()`)
- Form indicators: Hot/cold streak detection
- Consistency metrics: Inverse of rolling standard deviation
- Improvement trajectories: Linear trend slopes
- Clutch performance: 4th quarter/overtime scoring rates
- Examples: `points_form`, `points_is_hot`, `points_consistency`

**7. Feature Selection** (`select_features()`)
- Low variance removal: Eliminates constant features
- Correlation filtering: Removes redundant features (>0.95 correlation)
- Target correlation ranking: Selects top N features by predictive power
- Configurable limits: Max features parameter (default 100)

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ **[5.20_panel_data](../5.20_panel_data/README.md)** (rec_22) - REQUIRED for temporal operations
- ✅ pandas, numpy - Standard libraries

- [5.2_model_versioning](../5.2_model_versioning/README.md) - Track feature sets with MLflow
- [5.19_drift_detection](../5.19_drift_detection/README.md) - Monitor 80-100 features for drift

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Engineering for ML Training

```python
from implement_rec_11 import AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Initialize and load data
pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()
pipeline.setup()

df = pd.read_csv('player_games.csv')

# Generate features
results = pipeline.execute(demo_data=df)
features_df = results['engineered_df']
feature_names = results['selected_feature_names']

# Prepare for ML
X = features_df[feature_names]
y = features_df['win']

# Train model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Model accuracy: {model.score(X_test, y_test):.1%}")
# Expected: 68-71% (vs 63% with basic features)
```

### Example 2: Custom Feature Configuration

```python
# Only generate temporal and derived features
config = {
    "include_temporal": True,
    "include_cumulative": False,
    "include_interaction": False,
    "include_contextual": False,
    "include_derived": True,
    "lag_periods": [1, 3, 5],  # Fewer lags
    "rolling_windows": [5, 10],  # Shorter windows
}

pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline(config=config)
pipeline.setup()
results = pipeline.execute(demo_data=df)
```

### Example 3: Feature Selection Only

```python
# If you already have features and just want selection
from implement_rec_11 import AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline

pipeline = AdvancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()
selected_features = pipeline.select_features(
    df=your_dataframe,
    target_col='win',
    max_features=50
)

print(f"Selected {len(selected_features)} features:")
print(selected_features)
```

## Integration with Other Sub-Phases

### 5.20: Panel Data Processing (rec_22) - REQUIRED

rec_11 directly depends on rec_22's panel data infrastructure:
- `generate_lags()`: Creates lag features
- `generate_rolling_stats()`: Calculates rolling windows
- `generate_cumulative_stats()`: Computes career totals
- Panel index structure: (player_id, game_id, timestamp)

### 5.2: Model Versioning (MLflow)

Feature sets tracked in MLflow:
- Version control for feature configurations
- Log feature catalogs with model runs
- Compare model performance across feature sets

### 5.19: Drift Detection

Monitors all 80-100 features for drift:
- Detects when feature distributions change over time
- Alerts when new data differs significantly from training data
- Enables proactive model retraining

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_5/5.0001_feature_engineering
python test_rec_11.py -v

# Expected: All tests passing, ~20 second execution time
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for each feature category
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Edge case tests (missing data, single game, empty DataFrames)
- Performance tests (execution time, memory usage)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: "rec_22 not found"**
- Solution: Implement [5.20_panel_data](../5.20_panel_data/README.md) first (required dependency)

**Issue: Memory error with large datasets**
- Solution: Process players in batches (see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for batch processing code)

**Issue: Many NaN values in lag features**
- Solution: Expected for first N games. Use `dropna()` or `fillna(0)` as appropriate

**Issue: Feature generation is slow**
- Solution: Cache rolling stats, use Parquet instead of CSV, batch by player

See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for complete lessons learned and optimization strategies.
