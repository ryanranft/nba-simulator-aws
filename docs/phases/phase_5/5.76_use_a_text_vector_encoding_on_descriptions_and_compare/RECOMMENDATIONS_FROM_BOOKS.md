## Source Information

**Book:** Generative Deep Learning
**Chapter:** Chapter 13: Multimodal Models
**Category:** ML

---

## Recommendation Details

Given the explosion of multimodal models and language models, it may be very useful to encode the vector embedding to be aligned with these models. Incorporate the vector language embeddings into different parts of the architecture and determine the effects.

---

## Technical Details

Set up a text model and its tokenizer. Use the text model to encode descriptions and use the resulting embeddings as vector inputs.

---

## Expected Impact

Improved ability to utilize the text data and incorporate human language into the model.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 16 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
