## Recommendation Details

Utilize conjugate priors in real-time Bayesian analyses to enable faster posterior updates. Conjugate priors result in posteriors with the same distribution as the prior, allowing for closed-form calculations of the posterior, a significant boost in computational efficiency.

---

## Technical Details

Select appropriate conjugate priors for various data models. For example, beta priors for binomial data, gamma priors for Poisson data, and normal priors for normal data.

---

## Expected Impact

Speeds up posterior updates in real-time NBA analytics, enabling faster decision-making with limited computational resources.
