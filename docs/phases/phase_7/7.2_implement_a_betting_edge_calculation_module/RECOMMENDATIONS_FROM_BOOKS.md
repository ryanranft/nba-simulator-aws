## Source Information

**Book:** Econometrics versus the Bookmakers An econometric approach to sports betting
**Chapter:** 1 Introduction, 3 Theory
**Category:** Data Processing

---

## Recommendation Details

Create a module that compares the predicted probabilities from our model with the implied probabilities from bookmaker odds (converted using formula 1.1 from the book). Calculate the edge (difference between our prediction and bookmaker's prediction) for each outcome (home win, draw, away win).

---

## Technical Details

Python or R, integration with odds data API or data source, formula implementation (Probability = 1/Odds), edge calculation (Edge = Predicted Probability - Implied Probability).

---

## Expected Impact

Enables identification of potentially profitable betting opportunities based on discrepancies between our model's predictions and bookmaker's estimates.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 24 hours

---

## Dependencies

**Required Prerequisites:**

- Implement Extended Bradley-Terry Model for Match Outcome Prediction
