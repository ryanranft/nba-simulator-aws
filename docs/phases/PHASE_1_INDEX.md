# Phase 1: Data Quality & Gap Analysis

**Status:** ⏸️ READY TO IMPLEMENT (📚 2 enhancement recommendations available)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Prerequisites:** Phase 0 complete (data in S3)
**Estimated Time:** 28 hours over 4 weeks
**Cost Impact:** $5-8/month (additional sources)
**Started:** Not yet started
**Completion:** Pending

---

## Overview

Integrate multiple data sources to maximize ML granularity. Originally planned as simple data quality verification, this phase has evolved into comprehensive multi-source data integration to extract **209 features** for machine learning.

**This phase delivers:**
- **ESPN data (58 features):** Already in S3 - basic box scores, play-by-play
- **Basketball Reference (47 features):** Advanced metrics - TS%, PER, BPM, Win Shares, Four Factors
- **NBA.com Stats (92 features):** Player tracking - movement, touches, shot quality, hustle, defense
- **Kaggle (12 features):** Historical data - fill 1946-1998 gap
- **Derived features (20+ features):** Efficiency, momentum, contextual metrics

**Why multi-source integration matters:**
- ML accuracy boost: 63% → 75-80% (estimated +15-20%)
- Enables defensive impact metrics (not in ESPN)
- Historical coverage: 1946-2025 (vs 1993-2025)
- Confidence scoring for data quality

## Multi-Sport Replication

**When adding a new sport (NFL, MLB, NHL, Soccer):**

This phase is **sport-agnostic** - follow the same pattern:

### Step 1: Data Quality Checks (Sub-Phase 1.0 equivalent)
1. Analyze S3 coverage for new sport
2. Identify gaps
3. Upload local data if needed
4. Run automated gap filling
5. Establish quality baseline

### Step 2: Multi-Source Integration (Sub-Phase 1.1 equivalent)
1. Identify sport-specific data sources
2. Plan feature catalog (200+ features recommended)
3. Integrate each source incrementally
4. Create derived features
5. Validate cross-source consistency

**Example for NFL:**
- Primary: ESPN (already scraped)
- Secondary: NFL.com API, Pro Football Reference
- Historical: Kaggle NFL datasets
- Features: ~180-220 features across all sources

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

1. **Rate limiting from sources**
   - Solution: Implement exponential backoff
   - See Workflow #42 for scraper configuration

2. **Cross-source data conflicts**
   - Solution: Use confidence scoring, prioritize official sources
   - Document in discrepancies table

3. **Historical data gaps**
   - Solution: Use Kaggle datasets or Basketball Reference
   - Accept imperfect coverage for pre-2000 data
