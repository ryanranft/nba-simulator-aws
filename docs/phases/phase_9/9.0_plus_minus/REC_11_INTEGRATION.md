### Execution Flow

1. **Initialize pipeline** with config settings
2. **Setup dependencies** (rec_22, PlusMinusFeatureExtractor)
3. **Load data** (demo or real NBA data)
4. **Generate temporal features** (lags, rolling windows, trends) → +110 features
5. **Generate cumulative features** (career averages) → +21 features
6. **Generate plus/minus features** (RDS queries) → +26 features
   - For each unique game_id:
     - Query RDS PostgreSQL views
     - Extract lineup, player, possession, stint features
     - Merge back into DataFrame
7. **Return enhanced DataFrame** with 171 total features

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from scripts.ml.rec_11_with_plus_minus import EnhancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = EnhancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()

# Setup dependencies
pipeline.setup()

# Execute with demo data
results = pipeline.execute()

print(f"Total features: {results['total_features']}")
print(f"Plus/minus features: {results['feature_catalog'][2][1]}")
# Output: Total features: 171
# Output: Plus/minus features: 26
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    "include_temporal": True,
    "include_cumulative": True,
    "include_plus_minus": True,  # Enable plus/minus features
    "lag_periods": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "rolling_windows": [5, 10, 20],
    "plus_minus_enabled": True,
    "plus_minus_cache_ttl": 3600,  # Cache for 1 hour
}

pipeline = EnhancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline(config=config)
pipeline.setup()
results = pipeline.execute()
```

### Using with Real Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your NBA game data
df = pd.read_csv("nba_games.csv")

# Must include: player_id, game_id, game_number, points, rebounds, etc.
# For plus/minus: game_id must match RDS PostgreSQL game IDs

pipeline = EnhancedFeatureEngineeringPipeline()
pipeline.setup()
results = pipeline.execute(demo_data=df)

# Enhanced DataFrame with 171 features
enhanced_df = results.get("enhanced_data")
```

### Feature Selection

```python
# After feature engineering, select most important features
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel

# Enhanced DataFrame from pipeline
enhanced_df = pipeline.execute()["enhanced_data"]

# Separate features and target
X = enhanced_df.drop(["target", "player_id", "game_id"], axis=1)
y = enhanced_df["target"]

# Select top features using random forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
selector = SelectFromModel(rf, max_features=50)
selector.fit(X, y)

# Get selected features (including plus/minus features)
selected_features = X.columns[selector.get_support()]
print(f"Selected {len(selected_features)} features from 171 total")
```

## Configuration Options

### Feature Toggles

```python
config = {
    # Enable/disable feature categories
    "include_temporal": True,
    "include_cumulative": True,
    "include_interaction": False,  # Not in demo
    "include_contextual": False,   # Not in demo
    "include_derived": False,      # Not in demo
    "include_plus_minus": True,    # ✨ NEW

    # Temporal settings

```python
# Disable plus/minus features (fallback to base rec_11)
config["include_plus_minus"] = False

# Adjust extraction batch size (future optimization)
config["plus_minus_batch_size"] = 100  # Extract 100 games at once

# Enable feature caching (future optimization)
config["plus_minus_cache_enabled"] = True
config["plus_minus_cache_path"] = "/path/to/cache/"
```

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Sequential Extraction** - Plus/minus features extracted one game at a time
   - **Impact:** ~0.70s per game (reasonable but not optimal)
   - **Future:** Batch extraction could reduce to ~0.10s per game

2. **RDS Dependency** - Requires active RDS PostgreSQL connection
   - **Impact:** Cannot run offline
   - **Future:** Add local caching layer

3. **Game Coverage** - Only games with plus/minus data in RDS
   - **Impact:** Games without data get NaN features
   - **Mitigation:** Pipeline fills NaN with 0.0 or team averages

4. **DataFrame Fragmentation** - Iterative feature addition causes warnings
   - **Impact:** Minor performance degradation (not noticeable)
   - **Fix:** Use `pd.concat()` instead of iterative assignment

### Performance Warnings

```
PerformanceWarning: DataFrame is highly fragmented.
```

**What it means:** Pandas warns when many columns are added iteratively
**Impact:** Negligible for datasets < 100K rows
**Fix:** Use `pd.concat(axis=1)` for large datasets

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Plus/minus features all NaN

**Cause:** Game IDs in your data don't match RDS PostgreSQL
**Solution:** Ensure `game_id` format matches (e.g., "0021500001")

### Issue: Slow extraction (> 2 seconds per game)

**Cause:** RDS connection latency or database load
**Solution:**
1. Check RDS instance status
2. Optimize views (already optimized with CTEs)
3. Use batch extraction (future enhancement)

### Issue: Connection errors to RDS

**Cause:** Missing `.env` file or incorrect credentials
**Solution:**
1. Verify `.env` exists with RDS credentials
2. Check RDS security group allows connections
3. Test connection: `psql -h nba-sim-db.ck96ciigs7fy.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U postgres -d nba_simulator`

### Issue: ImportError for PlusMinusFeatureExtractor

**Cause:** Module not in Python path
**Solution:**
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws")
from scripts.ml.plus_minus_feature_extractor import PlusMinusFeatureExtractor
```
