## Technical Architecture

### Module: `scripts/ml/plus_minus_feature_extractor.py`

**Class:** `PlusMinusFeatureExtractor`

**Methods:**
1. `extract_lineup_features(game_id)` - 9 lineup efficiency metrics
2. `extract_player_impact_features(game_id)` - 7 player impact metrics
3. `extract_possession_features(game_id)` - 6 possession-based metrics
4. `extract_stint_features(game_id)` - 4 stint pattern metrics
5. `extract_game_features(game_id)` - All features (returns structured result)
6. `extract_features_as_dict(game_id)` - Flat dictionary for ML pipeline

**Database Integration:**
- Connects to RDS PostgreSQL
- Uses optimized views (100x faster queries)
- Auto-closes connections
- Error handling and logging

**Views Queried:**
- `vw_lineup_plus_minus` - Lineup efficiency metrics
- `vw_on_off_analysis` - Player impact metrics
- `lineup_snapshots` - Raw lineup data
- `player_plus_minus_snapshots` - Raw player data
- `possession_metadata` - Possession boundaries

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from scripts.ml.plus_minus_feature_extractor import PlusMinusFeatureExtractor

# Initialize extractor
extractor = PlusMinusFeatureExtractor()

# Extract all features for a game
result = extractor.extract_game_features(game_id='0021500001')

print(f"Total Features: {result.feature_count}")
print(f"Extraction Time: {result.extraction_time}")
```

### ML Pipeline Integration

```python
# Get features as flat dictionary (for ML models)
features = extractor.extract_features_as_dict(game_id='0021500001')

# Features are prefixed by category:
# - pm_lineup_*
# - pm_player_*
# - pm_poss_*
# - pm_stint_*

# Add to existing feature vectors
ml_features = {
    **existing_features,  # 249 static features
    **features            # 26 plus/minus features
}
# Total: 275 features
```

### Integration with Unified Feature Extractor

```python
from scripts.ml.unified_feature_extractor import UnifiedFeatureExtractor
from scripts.ml.plus_minus_feature_extractor import PlusMinusFeatureExtractor

# Extract base features
base_extractor = UnifiedFeatureExtractor()
base_features = base_extractor.extract_all_features(game_id, season)

# Extract plus/minus features
pm_extractor = PlusMinusFeatureExtractor()
pm_features = pm_extractor.extract_features_as_dict(game_id)

# Combine
combined_features = {
    **base_features['features'],
    **pm_features
}

# Result: 249 + 26 = 275 total features
```

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### Step 1: Add to UnifiedFeatureExtractor (Optional)
Update `scripts/ml/unified_feature_extractor.py` to include plus/minus features:

```python
class UnifiedFeatureExtractor:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.pm_extractor = PlusMinusFeatureExtractor()
        
    def extract_all_features_enhanced(self, game_id, season):
        base = self.extract_all_features(game_id, season)
        pm = self.pm_extractor.extract_features_as_dict(game_id)
        return {**base['features'], **pm}
```

### Step 2: Add to rec_11 Feature Engineering
Update `docs/phases/phase_0/implement_rec_11.py` to include plus/minus features in the 80+ engineered features.

### Step 3: Create Lineup Optimization Model
Use `vw_lineup_plus_minus` features to train a model that predicts best lineup combinations.

### Step 4: Create Player Impact Prediction Model
Use `vw_on_off_analysis` features to predict player replacement value.
