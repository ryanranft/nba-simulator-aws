# Sub-Phase 9.7: ML Feature Engineering Integration

**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Dependencies:** 9.6 (need advanced metrics)
**Started:** Not started
**Completed:** Not completed

## Objective

Integrate snapshot box scores with ML pipeline, create temporal feature sets, enable quarter-by-quarter predictions.

---

## Feature Sets to Create

### Temporal Rolling Features
- Last N plays box score state
- Rolling averages (last 5, 10, 20 events)
- Momentum indicators (scoring runs)

### Quarter-Specific Features
- Q1 performance → Q2 prediction
- Quarter-to-quarter trends
- Closing ability (Q4 performance)

### Player Combination Features
- 5-man lineup efficiency
- Player chemistry indicators
- Substitution impact

### Game Context Features
- Score differential trajectory
- Lead changes count
- Largest lead
- Time remaining
- Timeout usage

---

## Output

- Feature matrix ready for ML models
- One row per snapshot
- 100-500 features per snapshot
- Support for both game-level and quarter-level predictions

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Temporal features implemented
- ✅ Quarter features created
- ✅ Feature matrix generated
- ✅ ML models trained successfully
