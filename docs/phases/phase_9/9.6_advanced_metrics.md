# Sub-Phase 9.6: Advanced Metrics Layer

**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** 9.5 (need stored snapshots)
**Started:** Not started
**Completed:** Not completed

---

## Objective

Add advanced metrics not in original box scores to enhance ML prediction accuracy.

---

## Metrics to Implement

### Efficiency Metrics
- True Shooting % (TS%)
- Effective FG% (eFG%)
- Player Efficiency Rating (PER) - per snapshot
- Usage Rate
- Assist Ratio

### Advanced Stats
- Offensive Rating (ORtg)
- Defensive Rating (DRtg)
- Net Rating
- Pace (possessions per game)
- Four Factors (shooting, turnovers, rebounding, FT rate)

### Context Stats
- Win Probability at each snapshot
- Expected Points Added (EPA)
- Clutch performance (last 5 min of close games)
- Garbage time filtering

### Situational Stats
- Stats by quarter
- Home vs. Away splits
- Back-to-back game indicator
- Rest days since last game

---

## Implementation

Compute after base box scores verified, store in separate tables/columns, version metrics.

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All efficiency metrics implemented
- ✅ Advanced stats calculated per snapshot
- ✅ Context stats for ML features
- ✅ Documentation of formulas
