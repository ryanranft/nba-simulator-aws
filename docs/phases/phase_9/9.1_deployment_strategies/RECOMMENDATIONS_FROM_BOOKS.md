## Recommendations

### 1. Shadow Deployment

**ID:** `ml_systems_7`
**Priority:** NICE_TO_HAVE
**Source Book:** Designing Machine Learning Systems
**Status:** üìù Ready to create plan

**Description:**
Implement shadow deployment pattern for risk-free testing of new models in production.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Parallel model execution (production + shadow)
- Performance comparison without user impact
- Gradual rollout validation
- A/B testing preparation
- Rollback safety

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Design shadow deployment architecture
2. Implement request duplication logic
3. Create comparison metrics collection
4. Build analysis dashboards
5. Integrate with deployment pipelines

**Expected Impact:** LOW - Risk-free testing (nice-to-have)

**Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 9 deployment infrastructure
- Phase 5 model serving
- Monitoring dashboards

**Technical Details:**
- Use AWS Lambda for request duplication
- Store shadow results in separate database
- Compare predictions asynchronously
- No impact on production latency
