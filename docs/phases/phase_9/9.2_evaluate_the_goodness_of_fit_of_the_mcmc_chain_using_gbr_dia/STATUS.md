# Recommendation Status: Evaluate the Goodness of Fit of the MCMC Chain using GBR Diagnostics and other convergence metrics

**ID:** rec_019
**Name:** Evaluate the Goodness of Fit of the MCMC Chain using GBR Diagnostics and other convergence metrics
**Phase:** 9 (Testing)
**Source Books:** STATISTICS 601 Advanced Statistical Methods ( PDFDrive )
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ðŸ”µ **PLANNED**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours
**Dependencies:** 2 dependencies

---

## Description

It can sometimes be diï¬ƒcult to judge, in a MCMC estimation, that the values being simulated form an accurate assessment of the likelihood. To do so, utilize Gelman-Rubin Diagnostics and potentially other metrics for convergence that will prove helpful in determining if the chain is stable.

---

## Expected Impact

Guarantees accuracy of the MCMC by observing convergence, improving the certainty in predictions.
