**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Dependencies:** 9.7 (need ML features)
**Started:** Not started
**Completed:** Not completed

## Objective

Use quarter box scores to predict quarter outcomes, improve betting model accuracy, track performance vs Vegas lines.

---

## Features

### Quarter Prediction Models
- Predict Q2 outcome using Q1 box scores
- Predict Q3 outcome using Q1+Q2 box scores
- Predict Q4 outcome using Q1+Q2+Q3 box scores
- Predict final outcome at any point in game

### Real-Time Prediction Updates
- Update predictions after each play
- Track prediction confidence
- Flag high-value betting opportunities

### Backtesting System
- Historical quarter-by-quarter predictions
- Compare to actual outcomes
- Calculate ROI by quarter
- Identify profitable betting patterns

---

## How This Phase Enables the Simulation Vision

This phase provides critical infrastructure that powers the **hybrid econometric + nonparametric simulation system** described in the [main README](../../../README.md#simulation-methodology).

**What this phase enables:**

### 1. Econometric Causal Inference Foundation

This phase supports econometric causal inference:

**Panel data infrastructure:**
- Enables fixed effects and random effects estimation
- Supports instrumental variables (IV) regression
- Facilitates propensity score matching

**Causal identification:**
- Provides data for difference-in-differences estimation
- Enables regression discontinuity designs
- Supports synthetic control methods

**Treatment effect estimation:**
- Heterogeneous treatment effects across subgroups
- Time-varying treatment effects in dynamic panels
- Robustness checks and sensitivity analysis

### 2. Nonparametric Event Modeling (Distribution-Free)

This phase supports nonparametric event modeling:

**Empirical distributions:**
- Kernel density estimation for irregular events
- Bootstrap resampling from observed data
- Empirical CDFs without parametric assumptions

**Distribution-free methods:**
- No assumptions on functional form
- Direct sampling from empirical distributions
- Preserves tail behavior and extreme events

### 3. Context-Adaptive Simulations

Using this phase's capabilities, simulations adapt to:

**Game context:**
- Score differential and time remaining
- Playoff vs. regular season
- Home vs. away venue

**Player state:**
- Fatigue levels and minute load
- Recent performance trends
- Matchup-specific adjustments

### 4. Integration with Main README Methodology

**Panel data regression (Main README: Lines 81-87):**
- This phase supports panel data regression infrastructure

**Nonparametric validation (Main README: Line 116):**
- This phase supports nonparametric validation infrastructure

**Monte Carlo simulation (Main README: Line 119):**
- This phase supports Monte Carlo simulation infrastructure

**See [main README](../../../README.md) for complete methodology.**
