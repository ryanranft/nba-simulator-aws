## Quick Start

### Database Tables

```sql
-- 1. Lineup snapshots (400 rows per game)
SELECT * FROM lineup_snapshots
WHERE game_id = '0021500001'
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. Player +/- snapshots (2,159 rows per game)
SELECT * FROM player_plus_minus_snapshots
WHERE game_id = '0021500001' AND player_id = 201935
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Possession metadata (20 possessions per game avg)
SELECT * FROM possession_metadata
WHERE game_id = '0021500001'
ORDER BY possession_start_snapshot_id;
```

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Best lineups by net rating
SELECT lineup_hash, net_rating, possessions, plus_minus
FROM vw_lineup_plus_minus
WHERE game_id = '0021500001' AND possessions >= 5
ORDER BY net_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Player on/off differential
SELECT player_id, player_name,
       on_court_net_rating, off_court_net_rating, on_off_differential
FROM vw_on_off_analysis
WHERE game_id = '0021500001'
ORDER BY on_off_differential DESC;
```

### ML Feature Extraction

```python
from scripts.pbp_to_boxscore.plus_minus_calculator import PlusMinusCalculator
from scripts.ml.enhanced_feature_extractor import PlusMinusFeatureExtractor

# Extract Plus/Minus features
extractor = PlusMinusFeatureExtractor(db_connection)
features = extractor.extract_features(game_id='0021500001')

# Returns 26 features:
# - 9 lineup efficiency features
# - 5 player impact features
