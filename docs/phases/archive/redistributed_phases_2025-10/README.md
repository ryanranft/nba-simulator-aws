# Redistributed Phases Archive (October 2025)

**Archive Date:** October 26, 2025
**Reason:** Phase reorganization and consolidation per ADR-010

## What Happened

During the October 2025 project reorganization, the content from Phases 6-9 was redistributed into the core Phases 0-5 to create a more logical and maintainable structure.

### Original Structure (Before October 2025)

- **Phase 6:** Optional Enhancements
- **Phase 7:** Betting Integration
- **Phase 8:** Advanced Analytics
- **Phase 9:** Monitoring & Observability

### Redistribution Summary

All functionality from Phases 6-9 was integrated into expanded Phases 0-5:

- **Phase 0:** Now includes data infrastructure, security, and monitoring
- **Phase 1:** Enhanced with multi-source integration
- **Phase 2:** Expanded AWS & data pipeline capabilities
- **Phase 3:** Database infrastructure improvements
- **Phase 4:** Simulation engine enhancements
- **Phase 5:** Comprehensive ML/AI capabilities (214 recommendations)

### Why Archive Instead of Delete

These directories are preserved for:
1. **Historical reference** - Understanding project evolution
2. **Documentation continuity** - Old links and references
3. **Code recovery** - Access to original implementations if needed
4. **Audit trail** - Complete project history

### Related Documentation

- **ADR-010:** Four-digit sub-phase numbering standard
- **PROGRESS.md:** Current 5-phase structure
- **Session handoff files:** October 2025 reorganization details
