## Recommendation Details

Build the business logic for the inference pipeline into a REST API using FastAPI. This facilitates clear architectural separation between the model deployment and the business logic, promoting better development and operationalization of the system.

---

## Technical Details

Use FastAPI to create a REST API for the inference pipeline. Implement a /rag endpoint that accepts a user query and returns the modelâ€™s response. Create and deploy an API to the SageMaker endpoint that supports scaling and maintenance.

---

## Expected Impact

Modular and scalable serving architecture, accelerated development of the business logic, and optimized performance of the LLM Twin service.
