## Cost Breakdown

| Resource | Configuration | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| CloudWatch metrics | Standard metrics | $0 | Free tier covers most usage |
| CloudWatch alarms | 5-10 alarms | ~$1/month | $0.10/alarm |
| GitHub Actions | Public repo | $0 | Free for public repos |
| S3 logs | <1GB | ~$0.02/month | Log storage |
| **Total Phase Cost** | | **$0-2/month** | Minimal additional cost |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Use CloudWatch free tier metrics
- Limit custom metrics to essential only
- Archive logs to S3 Glacier after 30 days

---

## Prerequisites

**Before starting Phase 6:**
- [x] Phase 0-5 complete (core system operational)
- [ ] GitHub repository set up
- [ ] AWS CloudWatch access
- [ ] Python testing libraries (pytest)

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

**ADRs created in Phase 6:**
- Pytest over unittest (better fixtures, plugins)
- GitHub Actions over Jenkins (simpler setup)
- CloudWatch over Datadog (cost optimization)

**See:** `docs/adr/README.md`

---

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Testing Framework
- **Unit tests:** Individual function testing
- **Integration tests:** Component interaction testing
- **End-to-end tests:** Full workflow testing
- **Coverage:** 80%+ code coverage target

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- **On commit:** Run linting, tests, type checking
- **On PR:** Full test suite, code review checks
- **On merge:** Deploy to staging, run smoke tests
- **On release:** Deploy to production

### 3. Monitoring & Alerts
- **Metrics tracked:** API latency, error rates, resource usage
- **Alarms configured:** High error rate, slow queries, cost overruns
- **Dashboards:** Real-time system health, cost tracking

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Database:** Query optimization, index tuning
- **API:** Response caching, connection pooling
- **ETL:** Batch processing, parallel execution

---

## Multi-Sport Replication

**When adding a new sport (NFL, MLB, NHL, Soccer):**

This phase is **100% sport-agnostic** - all enhancements are reusable:

**Reusable components:**
- Testing framework (just adapt test data)
- CI/CD pipeline (works for any sport)
- Monitoring/alerting (metric names configurable)
- Cost tracking (aggregates across all sports)

**No sport-specific adaptations needed** - this phase is pure infrastructure.

---

## Key Workflows

**For Sub-Phase 6.0:**
- Workflow #13: Testing Framework
- Workflow #18: Cost Management
- Workflow #5: Task Execution

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

1. **Tests failing in CI but passing locally**
   - Solution: Check environment differences
   - Verify AWS credentials in GitHub secrets
   - Ensure test data consistency

2. **CloudWatch costs higher than expected**
   - Solution: Reduce custom metric frequency
   - Use metric filters instead of raw logs
   - Archive old logs to Glacier

3. **Performance optimizations not working**
   - Solution: Profile before optimizing
   - Measure impact with benchmarks
   - Focus on bottlenecks, not everything

4. **API documentation out of sync**
   - Solution: Auto-generate from code (Swagger)
   - Update docs as part of PR process
   - Version API docs alongside code

---

## Next Steps

**After Phase 6 complete:**
- âœ… System enhancements operational
- âœ… Core project complete (Phases 0-6)
- â†’ Optional: [Phase 7: Betting Odds Integration](PHASE_7_INDEX.md)
- â†’ Or: Begin Phase 0 expansion (Basketball Reference data collection)
