## Recommendation Details

Regularly visualize feature statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, histograms) for both training and production data to detect distribution shifts and data anomalies.

---

## Technical Details

Use Python with matplotlib or seaborn to generate plots of feature distributions. Compare distributions across different datasets to identify shifts. Set up automated alerts for significant shifts.

---

## Expected Impact

Early detection of data quality issues and distribution shifts.
