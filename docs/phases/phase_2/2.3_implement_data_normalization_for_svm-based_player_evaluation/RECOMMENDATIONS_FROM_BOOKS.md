## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Chapter 5: Support Vector Machines
**Category:** Data Processing

---

## Recommendation Details

Since SVM performance is sensitive to feature scaling, implement data normalization techniques (MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler) to ensure that all input features have comparable ranges. This will be used to evaluate players.

---

## Technical Details

Use `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` or `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` to transform the data. Choose StandardScaler for most cases unless specific features require a 0-1 range.

---

## Expected Impact

Improves the convergence and accuracy of SVM models for player evaluation and recommendation.

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 8 hours
