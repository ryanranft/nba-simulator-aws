# Recommendation Status: Monitor Loss of Originality of Classification Data Sets and Create Data Sets that Emphasize Particular Features of Interest

**ID:** rec_121
**Name:** Monitor Loss of Originality of Classification Data Sets and Create Data Sets that Emphasize Particular Features of Interest
**Phase:** 2 (Testing)
**Source Books:** Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 24 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

There will be a balance to maintain when creating synthesized data, which will involve tradeoffs between information noise and originality. One solution can be to weigh losses such that certain features of the synthesized image are emphasized, allowing for the creation of new and novel datasets.

---

## Expected Impact

Improve the creation of training instances and reduce the tendency of the models to memorize the input data.
