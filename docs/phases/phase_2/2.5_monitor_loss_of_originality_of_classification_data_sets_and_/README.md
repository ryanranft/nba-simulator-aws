# 2.5: Monitor Loss of Originality of Classification Data Sets and Create Data Sets that Emphasize Particular Features of Interest

**Sub-Phase:** 2.5 (Testing)
**Parent Phase:** [Phase 2: Feature Engineering](../PHASE_2_INDEX.md)
**Status:** ðŸ”µ PLANNED
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT
**Implementation ID:** rec_121

## Overview

There will be a balance to maintain when creating synthesized data, which will involve tradeoffs between information noise and originality. One solution can be to weigh losses such that certain features of the synthesized image are emphasized, allowing for the creation of new and novel datasets.

**Key Capabilities:**
- When creating training data, the DCGAN algorithm is prone to only memorizing the training data, as well as producing overly-smooth blends
- It can therefore become difficult to generate instances that have new and interesting features to them
- Introducing losses will allow you to emphasize and encourage the model to generate instances of rare categories or features, enabling testing of model biases.

**Impact:**
Improve the creation of training instances and reduce the tendency of the models to memorize the input data.

## Quick Start

```python
from implement_rec_121 import ImplementMonitorLossOfOriginalityOfClassificationDataSetsAndCreateDataSetsThatEmphasizeParticularFeaturesOfInterest

# Initialize implementation
impl = ImplementMonitorLossOfOriginalityOfClassificationDataSetsAndCreateDataSetsThatEmphasizeParticularFeaturesOfInterest()
impl.setup()

# Execute implementation
results = impl.execute()

print(f"Implementation complete: {results}")
```

## Architecture

### Implementation Steps

1. Step 1: Create a DCGAN module and create dataset.
2. Step 2: Determine the features that will be emphasized and re-calculate loss and accuracy for instances where these features occur.
3. Step 3: Test and monitor how the new set of instances affects model bias and outcomes.
