Implementation: Monitor Loss of Originality of Classification Data Sets and Create Data Sets that Emphasize Particular Features of Interest

Recommendation ID: rec_121
Source: Gans in action deep learning with generative adversarial networks
Priority: IMPORTANT

Description:
There will be a balance to maintain when creating synthesized data, which will involve tradeoffs between information noise and originality. One solution can be to weigh losses such that certain features of the synthesized image are emphasized, allowing for the creation of new and novel datasets.

Expected Impact:
Improve the creation of training instances and reduce the tendency of the models to memorize the input data.
