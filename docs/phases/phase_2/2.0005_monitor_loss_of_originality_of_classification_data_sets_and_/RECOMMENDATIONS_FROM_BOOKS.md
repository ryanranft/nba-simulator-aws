**Chapter:** Chapter 11
**Category:** Testing

## Recommendation Details

There will be a balance to maintain when creating synthesized data, which will involve tradeoffs between information noise and originality. One solution can be to weigh losses such that certain features of the synthesized image are emphasized, allowing for the creation of new and novel datasets.

---

## Technical Details

When creating training data, the DCGAN algorithm is prone to only memorizing the training data, as well as producing overly-smooth blends. It can therefore become difficult to generate instances that have new and interesting features to them. Introducing losses will allow you to emphasize and encourage the model to generate instances of rare categories or features, enabling testing of model biases.

---

## Expected Impact

Improve the creation of training instances and reduce the tendency of the models to memorize the input data.
