# Phase 2: AWS Glue ETL (Modified Approach)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (via local extraction scripts)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 0 complete (S3 data uploaded)
**Estimated Time:** 1 day
**Estimated Cost:** $0/month (bypassed AWS Glue)
**Started:** October 1, 2025
**Completed:** October 2, 2025

---

## Overview

Originally planned to use AWS Glue Crawler and ETL jobs for schema discovery and data extraction. After encountering Glue Crawler failures with large file counts (146K+ files), pivoted to local Python extraction scripts that read directly from S3 and write to RDS PostgreSQL.

**This phase includes:**
- ~~AWS Glue Crawler setup (attempted, failed)~~
- ~~AWS Glue ETL job creation (bypassed)~~
- ✅ Local Python extraction scripts (successful alternative)
- ✅ Direct S3 → RDS data pipeline
- ✅ Schema enhancement and data enrichment

---

## Approach Evolution

### Initial Plan (AWS Glue)
**Status:** ❌ ABANDONED

**Why it failed:**
1. **Single crawler** (70,522 files) → OutOfMemoryError after 90 min
2. **4 data-type crawlers** (11K-45K files each) → Internal Service Exception after 12 min
3. **Year-based crawlers** (365-366 files per year) → Planned but not implemented

**Root cause:** AWS Glue Crawler cannot handle deeply nested JSON at this scale (see `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` Issue #11)

### Final Approach (Local Extraction)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Why it succeeded:**
- Full control over JSON parsing and field extraction
- Direct S3 read → RDS write (no intermediate catalog)
- Custom schema with 58 columns (vs Glue's auto-discovery)
- Overnight automation with zero critical errors

---

## Implementation Steps

### Sub-Phase 2.1: Data Quality Analysis

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**Follow these workflows:**
- Workflow #34 ([Lessons Learned Review](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/34_lessons_learned_review.md))
  - **When to run:** BEFORE attempting AWS Glue Crawler setup
  - **Purpose:** Read LESSONS_LEARNED.md Issue #11 to avoid known Glue Crawler failures
  - **Decision:** Skip Glue Crawlers entirely for datasets with >100K files or deeply nested JSON

- Workflow #21 ([Data Validation](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/21_data_validation.md))
  - **When to run:** Before extraction scripts development
  - **Purpose:** Sample files to understand data quality (valid vs empty), identify pre-filter criteria
  - **Expected outcome:** ~17% empty files in ESPN data

**Completed tasks:**
1. ✅ Analyzed 500 sample files from S3
2. ✅ Discovered 83% files contain usable data, 17% empty
3. ✅ Documented JSON structure in `docs/DATA_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`
4. ✅ Identified 53 valuable fields in schedule data (vs original 9)

**Key findings:**
- Empty file rate: ~17% (24,507 files)
- Valid games: ~58,533 files
- Pre-filtering saves ~30% compute costs

**See `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` Issue #10 for complete analysis.**

- Workflow #32 ([RDS Connection](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/32_rds_connection.md))
  - **When to run:** Before testing database writes
  - **Purpose:** Verify RDS connection from local machine, test credentials

- Workflow #29 ([Style Enforcement](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/29_style_enforcement.md))
  - **When to run:** After writing scripts
  - **Purpose:** Ensure code follows project style (black, flake8, type hints)

- Workflow #16 ([Testing](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/16_testing.md))
  - **When to run:** After writing extraction scripts
  - **Purpose:** Test scripts with sample data before running on full dataset

- Workflow #30 ([Code Snippet Logging](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/30_code_snippet_logging.md))
  - **When to run:** After writing extraction scripts
  - **Purpose:** Log code snippets and outcomes to COMMAND_LOG.md for future reference

**Scripts created:**
1. ✅ `scripts/etl/complete_schema_update.py` - Add 25 new columns to games table
2. ✅ `scripts/etl/extract_schedule_local.py` - Extract 53 fields from schedule files
3. ✅ `scripts/etl/extract_pbp_local.py` - Extract play-by-play data
4. ✅ `scripts/etl/extract_boxscores_local.py` - Extract box score stats
5. ✅ `scripts/etl/auto_start_schedule_after_schema.sh` - Automation monitor

**Validation:**

### Sub-Phase 2.3: Overnight Extraction Execution

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Time Estimate:** 8 hours (overnight automation)
**Cost:** $0 (local compute, only S3 GET requests)

**Follow these workflows:**
- Workflow #2 ([Command Logging](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/02_command_logging.md))
  - **When to run:** Before starting extraction scripts
  - **Purpose:** Log commands to COMMAND_LOG.md for tracking and debugging

- Workflow #5 ([Task Execution](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/05_task_execution.md))
  - **When to run:** When launching overnight automation
  - **Purpose:** Follow task execution checklist, ensure logging and error handling

- Workflow #21 ([Data Validation](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/21_data_validation.md))
  - **When to run:** AFTER extraction completes
  - **Purpose:** Verify row counts, data integrity, completeness of extracted data

- Workflow #11 ([Error Handling](../claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/11_error_handling.md))
  - **When to run:** If extraction scripts encounter errors during overnight automation
  - **Purpose:** Handle S3 read errors, RDS write failures, connection timeouts, resume failed extractions

**Completed processes:**
1. ✅ Schema enhancement: Added 25/25 columns (1:00 AM completion)
2. ✅ Schedule extraction: 46,595 games with 53 fields (4:00 AM completion)
3. ✅ Play-by-play extraction: 6,781,155 plays (6:00 AM completion)
4. ✅ Box scores extraction: 408,833 player stats + 15,900 team stats (8:00 AM completion)

**Automation features:**
- Auto-start monitor: Waits for schema completion, then starts schedule extraction
- Progress logging: All processes logged to individual files
- Error handling: Zero critical errors encountered
- Write permissions: Verified for all log files and database

**Timeline:**
```
12:35 AM - Processes started

## Key Decisions

**Architecture decisions made:**
- **ADR-008 (implied):** Skip AWS Glue Crawler for large/complex datasets
  - Use local extraction scripts for full control
  - Direct S3 → RDS pipeline more reliable at scale
  - Saves $14/month in Glue costs

**User requirement fulfilled:**
- ✅ "I would like the schedule to have all of the data and be as rich as possible"
- Delivered: 53 fields (488% increase from 9 fields)
- Includes: All team metadata, venue details, broadcast info, game status, etc.

---

## Lessons Learned

**What worked:**
- ✅ Local Python scripts with full control over extraction
- ✅ Overnight automation with auto-start monitoring
- ✅ Direct S3 read → RDS write (no catalog needed)
- ✅ Pre-filtering empty files (saved 17% compute)

**What didn't work:**
- ❌ AWS Glue Crawler on 146K+ files (OutOfMemoryError)
- ❌ AWS Glue Crawler on 45K+ deeply nested JSON (Internal Service Exception)

**Recommendations for future sports:**
- Skip Glue Crawler for datasets with:
  - >100K files
  - Deeply nested JSON (5+ levels)
  - Large files (>500 KB each)
  - Web scraping data (embedded content)

**See `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` Issue #11 for complete analysis.**

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues encountered:**

1. **Glue Crawler OutOfMemoryError**
   - Root cause: 70,522 files exceeded DPU allocation
   - Solution: Pivoted to local extraction scripts
   - See workflow #34 (Lessons Learned Review)

2. **Schema mismatch between JSON and database**
   - Solution: Created custom schema with 58 columns
   - Script: `scripts/etl/complete_schema_update.py`

3. **Empty file handling**
   - 17% of files are empty (future/cancelled games)
   - Solution: Pre-filter before processing
   - Saved 30% compute costs
