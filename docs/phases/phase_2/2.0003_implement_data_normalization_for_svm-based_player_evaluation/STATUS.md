# Recommendation Status: Implement Data Normalization for SVM-Based Player Evaluation

**ID:** rec_077
**Name:** Implement Data Normalization for SVM-Based Player Evaluation
**Phase:** 2 (Data Processing)
**Source Books:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Since SVM performance is sensitive to feature scaling, implement data normalization techniques (MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler) to ensure that all input features have comparable ranges. This will be used to evaluate players.

---

## Expected Impact

Improves the convergence and accuracy of SVM models for player evaluation and recommendation.
