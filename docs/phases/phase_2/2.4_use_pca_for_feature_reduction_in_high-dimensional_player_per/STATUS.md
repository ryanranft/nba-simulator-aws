# Recommendation Status: Use PCA for Feature Reduction in High-Dimensional Player Performance Data

**ID:** rec_079
**Name:** Use PCA for Feature Reduction in High-Dimensional Player Performance Data
**Phase:** 2 (ML)
**Source Books:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

If the dataset used for player evaluation contains a large number of features (e.g., tracking data), use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving most of the variance. This reduces computational complexity and mitigates overfitting.

---

## Expected Impact

Improves model generalization, reduces computational load, and enhances interpretability.
