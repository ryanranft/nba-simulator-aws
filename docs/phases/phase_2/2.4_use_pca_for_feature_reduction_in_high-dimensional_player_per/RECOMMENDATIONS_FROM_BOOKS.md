## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Chapter 6: Principal Component Analysis
**Category:** ML

## Recommendation Details

If the dataset used for player evaluation contains a large number of features (e.g., tracking data), use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving most of the variance. This reduces computational complexity and mitigates overfitting.

---

## Technical Details

Use `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`. Determine the optimal number of components by examining the explained variance ratio. Set n_components to retain a specified percentage of variance (e.g., 90%).

---

## Expected Impact

Improves model generalization, reduces computational load, and enhances interpretability.

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 12 hours
