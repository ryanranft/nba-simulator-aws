## Source Information

**Book:** STATISTICS 601 Advanced Statistical Methods ( PDFDrive )
**Chapter:** Chapter 9.3
**Category:** Testing

---

## Recommendation Details

Simulate data from a fitted model to generate reference distributions for test statistics. Compare the observed test statistic to the reference distribution to assess model fit and identify potential inadequacies.

---

## Technical Details

Implement data simulation based on the selected distributions (e.g., Poisson, Normal, Bernoulli). Calculate appropriate test statistics and compare to the generated reference distributions.

---

## Expected Impact

Provides a powerful tool to evaluate model adequacy and identify potential areas for model improvement.
