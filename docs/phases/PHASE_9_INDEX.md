# Phase 9: Play-by-Play to Box Score Generation System

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING (üìö 2 enhancement recommendations available)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** 12 weeks (3 months)
**Cost Impact:** +$0.80-1.30/month

---

## Overview

Generate granular box score snapshots from play-by-play (PBP) data to enable:

1. **Temporal Box Scores**: Complete box score state after each play-by-play event
2. **Quarter Box Scores**: Separate stats for each quarter (betting odds forecasting)
3. **Verification System**: Compare generated final box scores against actual box scores
4. **Advanced Metrics**: Platform to add metrics not in original data
5. **ML Enhancement**: More accurate predictions with granular state data

**Strategy:** Start with recent games (2023-2025) where data is most accurate, then work backwards.

---

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- Phase 0 complete (data collection)
- ESPN play-by-play data in S3 (44,826 games)
- hoopR play-by-play data in RDS (13M rows)
- NBA API play-by-play data (1995-2006)
- Actual box scores for verification

**Optional:**
- Kaggle historical data for older games
- Basketball Reference data for cross-validation

```

**Processing Flow:**
1. Load PBP data from source (ESPN/hoopR/NBA API)
2. Parse each event sequentially
3. Update running box score
4. Create snapshot after each event
5. Track quarter boundaries
6. Verify final box score vs actual
7. Store in RDS + S3 Parquet

## Data Sources

| Source | Games | Date Range | Priority | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|-------|
| ESPN | 44,826 | 1993-2025 | HIGHEST | Start here, best quality |
| hoopR | ~30,000 | 2002-2025 | HIGH | Cross-validation |
| NBA API | ~22,000 | 1995-2006 | MEDIUM | Historical |
| Kaggle | 65,698 | 1946-2020 | LOW | Very old data |

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**
- ‚úÖ Process all 2023-2025 ESPN games (~2,952 games)
- ‚úÖ 99%+ verification accuracy
- ‚úÖ Quarter-by-quarter box scores generated
- ‚úÖ Stored in RDS + S3
- ‚úÖ Basic ML feature set created

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Data Quality Issues**
- Mitigation: Strict verification, quality grading (A-F)
- Fallback: Mark games uncertain, exclude from training

**Risk 2: Processing Too Slow**
- Mitigation: Parallel processing, caching, optimization
- Fallback: Process incrementally, prioritize recent games

**Risk 3: Storage Costs Exceed Budget**
- Mitigation: Compression, sampling, archiving
- Fallback: Store key snapshots only, not every play

**Risk 4: Verification Failures**
- Mitigation: Extensive testing, gradual rollout
- Fallback: Manual review, adjust logic
