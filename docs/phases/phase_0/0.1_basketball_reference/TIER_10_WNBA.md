CREATE TABLE wnba_season_totals (
    season INTEGER,
    player_slug TEXT,
    team TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    games INTEGER,
    minutes INTEGER,
    points INTEGER,

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Load WNBA data to RDS PostgreSQL**
2. **Create unified WNBA views**
3. **Update ML feature engineering pipeline**
4. **Run WNBA-specific analytics**
5. **Cross-validate with other data sources (if available)**

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Missing years (2004, 2010, 2016, 2020 All-Star Games)**
   - Solution: Skip these years in All-Star scraper, no data exists

2. **Defunct teams**
   - Solution: Maintain historical team mapping

3. **Different table IDs than NBA**
   - Solution: Inspect HTML, verify table IDs on WNBA pages

4. **Rate limiting**
   - Solution: Same as NBA (12s between requests)
