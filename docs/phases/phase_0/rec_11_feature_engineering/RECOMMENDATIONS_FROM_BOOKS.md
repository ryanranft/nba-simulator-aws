## Original Recommendations

### 1. From "Designing Machine Learning Systems" (Chip Huyen)

**Chapter 5: Feature Engineering**

**Key Quote:**
> "Feature engineering is often the difference between a model that performs at 60% accuracy and one that performs at 90%. Raw features rarely capture the complexity of real-world patterns—transformations, interactions, and domain knowledge unlock predictive power."

**Core Recommendations:**

1. **Temporal Features** (pp. 167-172)
   - Lag features capture recent history
   - Rolling windows reveal short-term trends
   - Trend indicators show improvement/decline
   - **NBA Application**: `points_lag1`, `fg_pct_rolling_10_mean`, `assists_trend_5`

2. **Interaction Features** (pp. 173-178)
   - Combine features to capture non-linear relationships
   - Domain knowledge guides which interactions matter
   - **NBA Application**: `points_home_avg` (player × venue), `minutes_by_rest` (player × fatigue)

3. **Feature Selection** (pp. 185-190)
   - Remove low-variance features (no signal)
   - Remove highly correlated features (redundancy)
   - Rank by predictive power
   - **NBA Application**: 300+ features → 80-100 selected features

**Quote on Panel Data:**
> "Time series data offers unique opportunities: every observation has a past that can inform predictions. Lag features and rolling statistics transform raw measurements into patterns that models can learn from."

---

### 2. From "Hands-On Machine Learning" (Géron)

**Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project**
**Chapter 4: Training Models**

**Key Insights:**

**Feature Scaling & Normalization** (pp. 68-75)
- Standardize features for gradient-based models
- Normalize by player baselines for fair comparison
- **NBA Application**: Per-36-minute stats, pace-adjusted stats

**Derived Features** (pp. 76-82)
- Ratios reveal efficiency (attempts vs makes)
- Per-unit metrics enable comparison across contexts
- **NBA Application**: `ts_pct` (true shooting %), `usage_rate`, `assist_ratio`

**Quote:**
> "The most powerful features are often not in your dataset—they're waiting to be created through thoughtful transformations that encode domain expertise."

**Polynomial & Interaction Features** (pp. 133-137)
- Higher-order relationships capture complexity
- But beware: exponential growth in feature count
- Solution: Domain-guided interactions only
- **NBA Application**: Player × opponent, home × rest (not all possible combinations)

---

### 3. From "Econometric Analysis of Panel Data" (Wooldridge)

**Chapter 11: Dynamic Panel Data Models**
**Chapter 13: Unbalanced Panels**

**Key Contributions:**

**Lag Operator Theory** (pp. 385-392)
- Lag features respect temporal ordering
- Multiple lags capture decay of influence
- **NBA Application**: `points_lag1` (last game), `points_lag5` (5 games ago)

**Rolling Window Statistics** (pp. 425-432)
- Recent form more predictive than career average
- Window size trades recency vs noise reduction
- **NBA Application**: Last 5 games (form), last 20 games (established performance)

**Cumulative Statistics** (pp. 447-455)
- Career totals capture experience effects
- Season-to-date reveals within-season trends
- **NBA Application**: `points_cumulative`, `games_cumulative`, `points_career_avg`

**Quote:**
> "Panel data's power lies in tracking entities over time. Within-player variation reveals how individuals respond to changing circumstances—fatigue, opponents, injuries. This temporal dimension is lost in cross-sectional analysis."

**Fixed vs Random Effects** (pp. 285-298)
- Player-specific baselines (fixed effects) remove inherent skill differences
- Focus on deviations: hot streaks, slumps, matchup effects
- **NBA Application**: Form indicators (`points_form` = recent avg - career avg)

---

### 4. From "Statistics 601: Statistical Modeling II"

**Lecture 7: Generalized Additive Models**
**Lecture 9: Interaction Effects**

**Key Concepts:**

**Non-Linear Transformations**
- Logarithmic transformations for skewed distributions
- Polynomial terms for curvature
- Splines for smooth non-linearity
- **NBA Application**: Minutes played (log), shooting percentages (logit transform for probabilities)

**Interaction Terms** (Lecture 9, pp. 12-18)
- Main effects alone assume independent relationships
- Interactions capture synergies and antagonisms
- **Example**: Points scored depends on both talent AND opponent strength
- **NBA Application**: Performance vs strong opponents (`points_vs_strong`) differs from vs weak

**Quote from Course Notes:**
> "Interactions are where the real world lives. Player A might excel at home but struggle on the road. Player B might thrive against weak defenses but disappear against elite teams. Ignoring interactions forces your model to average over these crucial distinctions."

**Seasonal Patterns** (Lecture 11, pp. 5-9)
- Basketball seasons have structure: early (finding rhythm), mid (peak), late (fatigue), playoff push
- Model performance as function of season phase
- **NBA Application**: `season_quarter`, `points_by_season_quarter`

---

### 5. From "The Elements of Statistical Learning" (Hastie et al.)

**Chapter 3: Linear Methods for Regression**
**Chapter 10: Boosting and Additive Trees**

**Feature Construction Principles:**

**Derived Variables** (pp. 83-94)
- Transform raw measurements into meaningful quantities
- Examples: Ratios, rates, efficiencies
- **NBA Application**:
  - Shooting efficiency: `ts_pct = points / (2 * (fga + 0.44 * fta))`
  - Rebound rate: `reb_rate = rebounds * team_minutes / (minutes * team_rebounds)`

**Feature Interactions in Trees** (pp. 337-345)
- Tree-based models automatically find interactions
- But explicit interactions help even trees
- Especially for rare combinations (back-to-back + road + altitude)
- **NBA Application**: `altitude × is_home`, `days_rest × minutes`

**Quote:**
> "Features are the language in which we describe the world to our models. Rich, expressive features enable simple models to capture complex patterns. Poor features force us toward complex models that struggle to generalize."

**Regularization & Feature Selection** (pp. 61-68)
- More features ≠ better performance
- Redundant features add noise
- **L1 regularization** (Lasso) forces sparse feature sets
- **NBA Application**: Start with 300+ features, select 80-100 via correlation filtering

## Specific Examples: Book Concepts → NBA Features

### Example 1: True Shooting Percentage

**Source:** *Elements of Statistical Learning* (Chapter 3, pp. 87)
> "Derived variables transform raw measurements into meaningful quantities. Shooting percentage alone is misleading—it ignores free throws and three-pointers. True Shooting accounts for all scoring efficiency."

**Formula:**
```
TS% = PTS / (2 * (FGA + 0.44 * FTA))
```

**Implementation:**
```python
if all(col in df.columns for col in ["points", "fga", "fta"]):
    df["ts_pct"] = df["points"] / (2 * (df["fga"] + 0.44 * df["fta"])).replace(0, 1)

    # Rolling TS% (recent shooting form)
    df["ts_pct_rolling_10"] = (
        df.groupby("player_id")["ts_pct"]
        .rolling(window=10, min_periods=1)
        .mean()
        .reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
    )
```

**Impact:** Single number summarizes scoring efficiency across all shot types

---

### Example 2: Form Indicators (Hot/Cold Streaks)

**Source:** *Designing ML Systems* (Chapter 5, pp. 175)
> "Recent performance relative to baseline reveals whether a player is in a hot streak or slump. This temporal deviation is highly predictive."

**Formula:**
```
Form = Recent Average (last 5 games) - Career Average
```

**Implementation:**
```python
for stat in ["points", "fg_pct"]:
    if stat in df.columns:
        recent_col = f"{stat}_rolling_5_mean"
        season_col = f"{stat}_career_avg"

        if recent_col in df.columns and season_col in df.columns:
            # Continuous form indicator
            df[f"{stat}_form"] = df[recent_col] - df[season_col]

            # Binary hot/cold indicator
            df[f"{stat}_is_hot"] = (df[f"{stat}_form"] > 0).astype(int)
```

**Impact:** Captures momentum effects that raw stats miss

---

### Example 3: Opponent Strength Interactions

**Source:** *Statistics 601* (Lecture 9, pp. 14-15)
> "Performance isn't constant—it varies with opponent strength. Model this explicitly: performance = f(talent, opponent, talent × opponent)."

**Implementation:**
```python
if "opponent_win_pct" in df.columns:
    # Classify opponents
    strong_opp = df["opponent_win_pct"] > 0.500

    for stat in ["points", "fg_pct"]:
        if stat in df.columns:
            # Separate performance vs strong/weak
            df[f"{stat}_vs_strong"] = df[stat].where(strong_opp, 0)
            df[f"{stat}_vs_weak"] = df[stat].where(~strong_opp, 0)

            # Average performance in each context
            df[f"{stat}_avg_vs_strong"] = (
                df.groupby("player_id")[f"{stat}_vs_strong"]
                .expanding()
                .mean()
                .reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
            )
```

**Impact:** Reveals whether players rise to challenges or struggle against elite competition

---

### Example 4: Fatigue/Seasonal Effects

**Source:** *Statistics 601* (Lecture 11, pp. 7)
> "NBA seasons have temporal structure. Players peak mid-season and tire late-season. Model performance as a function of season phase."

**Implementation:**
```python
if "game_number" in df.columns:
    # Divide season into quarters
    df["season_quarter"] = pd.cut(
        df["game_number"],
        bins=[0, 20, 41, 61, 82],
        labels=["early", "mid", "late", "playoff_push"]
    )

    # Performance by season phase
    for stat in ["minutes", "points"]:
        if stat in df.columns:
            df[f"{stat}_by_season_quarter"] = df.groupby(
                ["player_id", "season_quarter"]
            )[stat].transform(lambda x: x.expanding().mean())
```

**Impact:** Captures fatigue effects and motivation spikes (playoff push)
