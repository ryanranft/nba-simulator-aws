# 0.5: Data Extraction & Structured Output

**Sub-Phase:** 0.5 (Data Extraction & Processing)
**Parent Phase:** [Phase 0: Data Collection](../PHASE_0_INDEX.md)
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Implementation:** Book recommendation variations

## Overview

Structured data extraction framework for reliable and consistent data collection from multiple NBA data sources. Ensures data quality and format consistency across ESPN, Basketball Reference, NBA API, and other sources.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Structured output extraction with validation
- Schema enforcement and type checking
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Data normalization across sources
- Quality assurance checks

---

## Quick Start

```python
from data_extraction import StructuredDataExtractor

# Initialize extractor with schema
extractor = StructuredDataExtractor(
    schema_path='schemas/nba_game.json',
    validate_types=True,
    strict_mode=True
)

# Extract structured data
result = extractor.extract(raw_data)
if result.is_valid:
    validated_data = result.data
    print(f"Extracted {len(validated_data)} records")
```

## How This Phase Enables the Simulation Vision

This phase provides critical infrastructure that powers the **hybrid econometric + nonparametric simulation system** described in the [main README](../../../README.md#simulation-methodology).

**What this phase enables:**

### 1. Econometric Causal Inference Foundation

Data collection infrastructure provides raw material for causal inference:

**Panel data structure:**
- **Temporal precision:** Enables within-unit variation analysis (player-game, team-season observations)
- **Longitudinal tracking:** Supports fixed effects models controlling for unobserved heterogeneity
- **Time-varying covariates:** Captures dynamic relationships for panel regression

**Causal identification:**
- **Instrumental variables:** Provides data for IV estimation (draft position, injuries as instruments)
- **Natural experiments:** Collects data around policy changes (rule changes, coaching transitions)
- **Regression discontinuity:** Captures data at cutoffs (playoff thresholds, draft lottery)

**Treatment effect estimation:**
- Propensity score matching: Comparable observations across treatment/control groups
- Difference-in-differences: Pre/post treatment data for causal impact estimation
- Heterogeneous effects: Data stratification for subgroup analysis

### 2. Nonparametric Event Modeling (Distribution-Free)

Raw data enables empirical distribution estimation without parametric assumptions:

**Irregular event frequencies:**
- **Kernel density estimation:** Models technical fouls, coach's challenges, ejections using empirical densities
- **Bootstrap resampling:** Generates injury occurrences by resampling from observed transaction data
- **Empirical CDFs:** Draws flagrant fouls, shot clock violations directly from observed distributions

**Performance variability:**
- **Quantile regression:** Models shooting "hot streaks" with fat-tailed distributions
- **Empirical transition matrices:** Captures make/miss patterns without geometric assumptions
- **Changepoint detection:** Identifies momentum shifts using PELT on play-by-play data

**Distribution-free inference:**
- No parametric assumptions (no Poisson, normal, exponential)
- Directly sample from empirical distributions
- Preserve tail behavior and extreme events

### 3. Context-Adaptive Simulations

Using collected data, simulations adapt to:

**Historical context:**
- Queries team standings at exact date to model "playoff push" vs. "tanking" behavior
- Uses schedule density (back-to-backs, road trips) for fatigue modeling
- Incorporates playoff seeding implications in late-season game intensity

**Player career arcs:**
- Estimates aging curves with player fixed effects + time-varying coefficients
- Models "prime years" vs. "declining phase" using nonlinear age effects
- Tracks skill evolution (3PT%, assist rates) across player development

**Game situation dynamics:**
- Adapts strategy based on real-time score differential
- Incorporates time remaining for late-game adjustments
- Uses momentum detection for psychological effects

### 4. Integration with Main README Methodology

**Panel data regression (Main README: Lines 81-87):**
- Collected data forms player-season, team-game panel structure for econometric analysis

**Nonparametric validation (Main README: Line 116):**
- Collected event frequencies validated using distribution-free tests (K-S, Anderson-Darling)

**Monte Carlo simulation (Main README: Line 119):**
- Collected data provides empirical distributions for Monte Carlo sampling with uncertainty

**See [main README](../../../README.md) for complete methodology.**
