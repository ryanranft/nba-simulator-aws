1. **Minutes Played** - Basic stat
2. **True Shooting %** - Exact match
3. **Effective FG %** - Exact match
4. **3-Point Attempt Rate (3PAr)** - Exact match
5. **Free Throw Rate** - Exact match (called `ft_rate`)
6. **ORB%** - Exact match
7. **DRB%** - Exact match
8. **TRB%** - Exact match
9. **AST%** - Implemented ✅ **NEW**
10. **STL%** - Implemented ✅ **NEW**
11. **BLK%** - Implemented ✅ **NEW**
12. **TOV%** - Exact match (called `turnover_rate`)
13. **USG%** - Have formula (called `usage_rate`)
14. **ORtg** - Exact match

### Implementation Notes

**AST%, STL%, BLK%:**
- Use Basketball Reference formulas
- Estimate "while on floor" stats using team minutes ratio
- Full accuracy requires play-by-play substitution tracking

**BPM:**
- Simplified version (not full Basketball Reference formula)
- Full BPM requires league-wide regression coefficients updated each season
- Our version provides directionally correct estimates

---

## Additional Stats We Have (Not on Basketball Reference)

We have several advanced stats that Basketball Reference doesn't show in the box score:

1. **Game Score** - Hollinger's overall contribution metric
2. **TS Attempts** - True shooting attempts (FGA + 0.44*FTA)
3. **Four Factors** - Dean Oliver's winning factors
4. **Pace** - Possessions per 48 minutes
5. **Possessions** - Estimated team possessions
6. **Net Rating** - ORtg - DRtg
7. **Assist to Turnover Ratio** - AST / TOV
8. **Points breakdown:**
   - Points in Paint
   - Second Chance Points
   - Fast Break Points
   - Points off Turnovers
   - Bench Points (teams)

## Formulas for Missing Stats

### 1. Assist Percentage (AST%)
```python
def assist_percentage(player_ast: int, team_fgm_while_on_floor: int,
                      player_fgm: int, team_minutes: float,
                      player_minutes: float) -> float:
    """
    AST% = (Player AST * Team Minutes) /
           (Player Minutes * (Team FGM - Player FGM))

    Estimates % of teammate FG assisted while player on floor
    """
    if player_minutes == 0:
        return 0.0

    teammate_fgm = team_fgm_while_on_floor - player_fgm
    if teammate_fgm == 0:
        return 0.0

    return ((player_ast * team_minutes) /
            (player_minutes * teammate_fgm)) * 100
```

**Note:** Requires tracking team stats WHILE player is on floor

---

### 2. Steal Percentage (STL%)
```python
def steal_percentage(player_stl: int, team_minutes: float,
                    player_minutes: float,
                    opponent_poss_while_on_floor: float) -> float:
    """
    STL% = (Player STL * Team Minutes) /
           (Player Minutes * Opponent Possessions)

    Estimates steals per 100 opponent possessions
    """
    if player_minutes == 0 or opponent_poss_while_on_floor == 0:
        return 0.0

    return ((player_stl * team_minutes) /
            (player_minutes * opponent_poss_while_on_floor)) * 100
```

**Note:** Requires tracking opponent possessions while player on floor

---

### 3. Block Percentage (BLK%)
```python
def block_percentage(player_blk: int, team_minutes: float,
                    player_minutes: float,
                    opponent_2pt_fga_while_on_floor: int) -> float:
    """
    BLK% = (Player BLK * Team Minutes) /
           (Player Minutes * Opponent 2PT FGA)

    Estimates blocks per 100 opponent 2PT attempts
    """
    if player_minutes == 0 or opponent_2pt_fga_while_on_floor == 0:
        return 0.0

    return ((player_blk * team_minutes) /
            (player_minutes * opponent_2pt_fga_while_on_floor)) * 100
```

**Note:** Requires tracking opponent 2PT FGA while player on floor

---

### 4. Box Plus/Minus (BPM)

BPM is extremely complex and requires:
- League-wide regression coefficients (updated each season)
- Player position
- Team pace
- League average ORtg
- Regression equation with ~10 terms

**Not recommended to implement** unless you have:
1. Historical league averages
2. Regression coefficients for each season
3. Position classifications

Basketball-Reference uses a proprietary calculation based on research by Daniel Myers.

## Implementation Priority

### ✅ Completed (Quick Win)

1. **3PAr** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
   - Added to schema: `three_point_attempt_rate REAL`
   - Added to `AdvancedStatsCalculator`
   - Formula: `3PA / FGA * 100`
   - Working in demo with realistic NBA data

### Medium Priority (Require "While On Floor" Tracking)

1. **AST%** - Fix current implementation
   - Need to track teammate FGM while player on floor
   - Requires play-by-play substitution tracking

2. **STL%** - Add to schema and calculator
   - Need to track opponent possessions while on floor
   - Requires play-by-play tracking

3. **BLK%** - Add to schema and calculator
   - Need to track opponent 2PT FGA while on floor
   - Requires play-by-play tracking

### Low Priority (Complex)

4. **BPM** - Very complex statistical model
   - Requires league-wide data and regression
   - Recommend skipping unless critical

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### ✅ Phase 1: Add Simple Stats - COMPLETED
- ✅ Added `three_point_attempt_rate REAL` to both player and team schemas
- ✅ Added `three_point_attempt_rate()` to `AdvancedStatsCalculator`
- ✅ Working demo with realistic NBA data
- ✅ Documentation updated

### Phase 2: Track "While On Floor" Stats (Next Priority)
This requires enhancing the PBP processor to track:
- When each player enters/exits the game
- Team stats accumulated while each player on floor
- Opponent stats accumulated while each player on floor

Example structure:
```python
player_on_floor_stats = {
    'player_id': {
        'teammate_fgm': 15,
        'opponent_poss': 45,
        'opponent_2pt_fga': 30,
        'minutes_played': 28.5
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Percentage Stats
Once "while on floor" tracking is in place:
- Calculate proper AST%
- Calculate STL%
- Calculate BLK%
