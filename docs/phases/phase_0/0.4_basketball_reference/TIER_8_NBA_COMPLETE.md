## Data Quality Checks

### For Each Data Type:

1. **Record Count Validation**
   - Referees: ~40,000 games with assignments (1988+)
   - Transactions: ~10,000 transactions (79 seasons × ~125 per season)
   - Records: ~1,000 unique records

2. **Coverage Verification**
   - Referee data from 1988+ (when tracked)
   - All major trades captured
   - All major records documented

3. **Data Structure Validation**
   - Referee assignments have 3 officials per game
   - Transactions have valid dates
   - Records have valid stat values

4. **Cross-Validation**
   - Referee foul calls sum to game totals
   - Transactions match roster changes
   - Records match known historical values

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Referee data not available pre-1988**
   - Solution: Document coverage window
   - Focus on modern era

2. **Transaction details may be incomplete**
   - Solution: Capture what's available
   - Link to external sources for contract details

3. **Records update frequently (active players)**
   - Solution: Re-scrape periodically
   - Version control records

4. **Trade details can be complex (multi-team, picks)**
   - Solution: Parse to best ability
   - Store raw notes field for complex trades

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Load data to RDS PostgreSQL
2. Analyze referee impact on game outcomes
3. Build trade value index
4. Create active record tracker
5. Begin Tier 9 (Historical Leagues: ABA & BAA)
