- **Status:** Proposals completed or superseded by actual implementations

### consolidated_rec_21_infrastructure.yaml

## Why Archive?

These files were moved to the archive to:
1. **Reduce Clutter:** Keep main Phase 0 directory focused on active implementations
2. **Preserve History:** Maintain files for future reference without deleting
3. **Improve Navigation:** Make it easier to find relevant, current documentation

---

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed in the future, they can be moved back to the main Phase 0 directory.
