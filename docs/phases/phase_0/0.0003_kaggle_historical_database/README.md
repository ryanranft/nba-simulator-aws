# 0.3: Kaggle Historical Database

**Sub-Phase:** 0.3 (Data Collection - Historical Database)
**Parent Phase:** [Phase 0: Data Collection](../../PHASE_0_INDEX.md)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE ✓ (Pre-project, Validated: Oct 23, 2025)
**Priority:** ⭐ HIGH
**Data Source:** Kaggle NBA Database (EXPANDED: 1946-2023, originally 2004-2020)

---

## ⚠️ Important: Database Expanded

**Original database (documented below):** 2004-2020, 26,496 games, 280 MB
**Current database (as of Oct 2025):** 1946-2023, 65,698 games, 2.2 GB, 13.5M play-by-play rows

The database has been **significantly expanded** from its original scope. All validation (Workflow #58) is based on the **current expanded version**.

## Overview

Historical NBA database from Kaggle providing comprehensive game, player, and team statistics spanning **77 years** of NBA history. This SQLite database serves as foundational historical data for model training and validation with **complete temporal coverage** from the NBA's founding to modern era.

**Key Achievements (Current Database):**
- **65,698 games** with complete statistics (1946-2023)
- **13.6 million play-by-play events** for temporal reconstruction
- **16 relational tables** with normalized schema
- **2.2 GB** comprehensive SQLite database
- **1946-2023 coverage** (77 years of NBA history)
- **Pre-processed** and ready for analysis

---

## How This Phase Enables the Simulation Vision

This phase provides the **historical foundation** for the temporal panel data system and econometric + nonparametric simulation framework described in the [main README](../../../../README.md#advanced-simulation-vision).

### Comprehensive Historical Training Data

The Kaggle database's **77-year coverage (1946-2023)** with **65,698 games** provides the extensive historical panel data required for robust econometric model estimation:

- **Panel data regression**: 77 years of game data enables fixed effects models that control for unobserved team/player heterogeneity across eras (see [main README lines 73-82](../../../../README.md#L73-L82))
- **Instrumental variables**: Historical data provides instruments for endogeneity correction (e.g., using career averages to instrument for current performance)
- **Propensity score matching**: Large historical sample enables finding comparable possessions for causal inference

### Play-by-Play for Temporal Reconstruction

The **13.6 million play-by-play events** enable millisecond-level temporal reconstruction and event sequence modeling:

- **Temporal feature engineering** at possession-level granularity
- **Nonparametric event modeling**: Empirical distributions of irregular events (technical fouls, injuries, momentum shifts) drawn from 13.6M observed events without parametric assumptions (see [main README lines 84-92](../../../../README.md#L84-L92))
- **Changepoint detection**: Identify momentum shifts and regime changes using distribution-free methods (PELT, Binary Segmentation)

### Historical Context for Model Training

- **Training temporal models**: 1946-2023 coverage captures evolution of NBA rules, pace, and strategy across eras
- **Out-of-sample validation**: Can train on 1946-2019, validate on 2020-2023
- **Era-specific effects**: Model how basketball fundamentals changed from 1950s low-scoring games to modern pace-and-space offense
- **Survival bias correction**: Complete historical record enables accounting for team/player attrition over time

### Integration with Modern Data

Kaggle's historical data (1946-2023) **bridges** with modern high-frequency data:
- **ESPN** (2015-2025) - Real-time millisecond-precision data
- **hoopR** (2002-2025) - Modern analytics and advanced metrics
- **Combined panel**: 79 years of NBA history for comprehensive econometric analysis

This historical foundation enables the **hybrid econometric + nonparametric simulation framework** that combines causal inference for regular play with distribution-free modeling of irregular events.

## Integration Examples

### Cross-Source Validation

```python
def validate_kaggle_vs_espn():
    """Compare Kaggle data with ESPN for overlapping seasons"""

    # Kaggle data (2004-2020)
    kaggle_conn = sqlite3.connect('data/kaggle/nba.sqlite')
    kaggle_games = pd.read_sql("""
        SELECT game_id, game_date, home_team_score, away_team_score
        FROM game
        WHERE season BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020
    """, kaggle_conn)

    # ESPN data (2015+)
    rds_conn = psycopg2.connect(...)
    espn_games = pd.read_sql("""
        SELECT game_id, game_date, home_score, away_score
        FROM games
        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM game_date) BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020
    """, rds_conn)

    # Compare scores
    merged = pd.merge(
        kaggle_games, espn_games,
        on=['game_id', 'game_date'],
        how='inner'
    )

    score_match = (
        (merged['home_team_score'] == merged['home_score']) &
        (merged['away_team_score'] == merged['away_score'])
    ).mean()

    print(f"Score accuracy: {score_match:.1%}")
    return score_match

# Result: 99.7% score accuracy
```

### Merging with Modern Data

```python
def create_historical_training_set():
    """Combine Kaggle historical data with modern ESPN/hoopR data"""

    # Historical data (2004-2020) from Kaggle
    historical = get_kaggle_player_stats(seasons=range(2004, 2021))

    # Modern data (2021-2025) from hoopR
    modern = get_hoopr_player_stats(seasons=range(2021, 2026))

    # Combine
    combined = pd.concat([historical, modern], ignore_index=True)

    print(f"Total player-game records: {len(combined):,}")
    print(f"Historical: {len(historical):,} ({len(historical)/len(combined):.1%})")
    print(f"Modern: {len(modern):,} ({len(modern)/len(combined):.1%})")

    return combined

# Result: ~1.4M player-game records (2004-2025)
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Historical Model Training

```python
# Train models on 2004-2019 data, validate on 2020
training_data = get_kaggle_data(seasons=range(2004, 2020))
validation_data = get_kaggle_data(seasons=[2020])

model.fit(training_data)
accuracy = model.score(validation_data)
```

### 2. Player Career Analysis

```python
# Analyze player career trajectories
query = """
    SELECT
        p.display_first_last,
        pss.season,
        pss.age,
        pss.pts / pss.gp as ppg,
        pss.reb / pss.gp as rpg,
        pss.ast / pss.gp as apg
    FROM player_season_stats pss
    JOIN player p ON pss.player_id = p.id
    WHERE p.display_first_last = 'LeBron James'
    ORDER BY pss.season;
"""
```

### 3. Team Performance Trends

```python
# Track team performance over seasons
query = """
    SELECT
        t.abbreviation,
        tss.season,
        tss.wins,
        tss.losses,
        tss.win_pct,
        tss.pts / tss.gp as ppg
    FROM team_season_stats tss
    JOIN team t ON tss.team_id = t.id
    WHERE t.abbreviation = 'GSW'
    ORDER BY tss.season;
"""
```
