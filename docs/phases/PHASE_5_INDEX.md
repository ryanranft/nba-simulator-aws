## Cost Breakdown

| Resource | Configuration | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Local training | Free (CPU/GPU) | $0 | Sufficient for development |
| SageMaker (optional) | ml.m5.xlarge | $50/month | For large-scale training |
| S3 model storage | <1GB | ~$0.02/month | Model artifacts |
| **Total Phase Cost** | | **$0-50/month** | Depends on training volume |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Train locally for development (free)
- Use SageMaker only for production model training
- Cache feature engineering results to avoid recomputation

---

## Prerequisites

**Before starting Phase 5:**
- [x] Phase 0-4 complete (simulation engine operational)
- [x] Temporal features available in database
- [ ] Python ML libraries (scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow)
- [ ] Training data prepared (labeled historical games)

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

**ADRs created in Phase 5:**
- XGBoost over Random Forest (better accuracy)
- Local training over SageMaker (cost optimization)
- Feature engineering focused on temporal patterns

**See:** `docs/adr/README.md`

---

## Feature Engineering

**Temporal features extracted:**
1. **Cumulative stats at timestamp:** Points, rebounds, assists up to exact moment
2. **Momentum indicators:** Last 5 games, last 10 minutes, hot/cold streaks
3. **Contextual variables:** Home/away, rest days, injuries, matchups
4. **Player interactions:** Lineup net rating, +/- combinations
5. **Derived metrics:** PER, TS%, usage rate, win shares

**Total features:** 150-200 depending on data availability

**See:** `docs/ML_FEATURE_CATALOG.md` for complete feature breakdown

---

## Model Performance

### Baseline (Monte Carlo only)
- **Accuracy:** 63%
- **Method:** Probabilistic simulation, no ML

### Random Forest
- **Accuracy:** 70%
- **Training time:** ~30 minutes
- **Pros:** Interpretable, fast
- **Cons:** Prone to overfitting

### XGBoost (Best Model)
- **Accuracy:** 75%
- **Training time:** ~45 minutes
- **Pros:** Best performance, handles missing data
- **Cons:** Longer training, less interpretable

### Neural Network (Experimental)
- **Accuracy:** 72%
- **Training time:** ~2 hours
- **Pros:** Flexible, can capture complex patterns
- **Cons:** Requires more data, overfits easily

**Target:** 75-80% accuracy (achieved 75% with XGBoost)

---

## Multi-Sport Replication

**When adding a new sport (NFL, MLB, NHL, Soccer):**

This phase is **mostly sport-agnostic** - ML pipeline is reusable:

**Reusable components:**
- Feature engineering framework
- Model training pipeline
- Hyperparameter tuning workflow
- Model evaluation metrics

**Sport-specific adaptations:**
- Feature definitions (sport-specific stats)
- Outcome variable (win/loss, score differential)
- Feature importance ranking (different factors matter per sport)

**Example for NFL:**
```python
# NFL-specific features
features = [
    'passing_yards_cumulative',
    'rushing_yards_cumulative',
    'turnovers',
    'time_of_possession',
    'third_down_conversion_rate',
    # ... NFL-specific temporal features
]
```

---

## Key Workflows

**For Sub-Phase 5.0:**
- Workflow #13: Testing Framework
- Workflow #5: Task Execution
- Workflow #2: Command Logging

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

1. **Model overfitting (high train, low test accuracy)**
   - Solution: Increase regularization
   - Reduce model complexity
   - Get more training data

2. **Feature engineering slow**
   - Solution: Cache computed features
   - Use materialized views in database
   - Parallelize feature computation

3. **Low model accuracy**
   - Solution: Add more features (Phase 1 multi-source)
   - Try different model architectures
   - Tune hyperparameters more aggressively

4. **Training takes too long**
   - Solution: Reduce training data size (sample)
   - Use faster models (Random Forest over Neural Net)
   - Consider distributed training (SageMaker)
