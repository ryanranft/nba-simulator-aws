## Source Information

**Book:** Practical MLOps  Operationalizing Machine Learning Models
**Chapter:** Chapter 4: Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning Models
**Category:** Architecture

---

## Recommendation Details

Use canary deployments to gradually roll out new model versions to a subset of users. This allows for testing and validation in a production environment with limited risk.

---

## Technical Details

Implement a load balancer or traffic management system to route a percentage of traffic to the new model version. Monitor performance metrics (accuracy, latency, error rate) for both the old and new versions. Use a service mesh like Istio.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduces risk associated with model deployments, allows for real-world testing, and minimizes potential impact on users.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** IMPORTANT
**Estimated Time:** 24 hours

---

## Dependencies

**Required Prerequisites:**

- Automate Model Retraining with ML Pipelines
- Monitor Model Performance with Drift Detection
