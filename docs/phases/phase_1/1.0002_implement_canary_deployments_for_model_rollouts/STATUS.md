# Recommendation Status: Implement Canary Deployments for Model Rollouts

**ID:** rec_007
**Name:** Implement Canary Deployments for Model Rollouts
**Phase:** 1 (Architecture)
**Source Books:** Practical MLOps  Operationalizing Machine Learning Models
**Priority:** IMPORTANT
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 24 hours
**Dependencies:** 2 dependencies

---

## Description

Use canary deployments to gradually roll out new model versions to a subset of users. This allows for testing and validation in a production environment with limited risk.

---

## Expected Impact

Reduces risk associated with model deployments, allows for real-world testing, and minimizes potential impact on users.
