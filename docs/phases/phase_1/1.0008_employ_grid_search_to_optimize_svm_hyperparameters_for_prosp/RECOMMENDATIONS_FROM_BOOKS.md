## Recommendation Details

When using SVM to evaluate the potential of prospective players, implement `GridSearchCV` to find optimal hyperparameter combinations (kernel, C, gamma) to maximize the accuracy of prospect evaluation using cross-validation.

---

## Technical Details

Use `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` with `sklearn.svm.SVC`. Test different combinations of kernel, C, and gamma.  Use 5-fold cross-validation.

---

## Expected Impact

Improves SVM model accuracy and reliability in evaluating prospects, leading to optimized resource allocation and better team composition.
