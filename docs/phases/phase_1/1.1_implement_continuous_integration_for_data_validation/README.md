# 1.1: Implement Continuous Integration for Data Validation

**Sub-Phase:** 1.1 (Data Processing)
**Parent Phase:** [Phase 1: Data Quality](../PHASE_1_INDEX.md)
**Status:** üîµ PLANNED
**Priority:** ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Implementation ID:** rec_001

---

## Overview

Set up continuous integration (CI) to automatically validate data quality after ingestion. This ensures data integrity and consistency.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Use a CI tool like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI
- Implement data validation checks using Python with libraries like Pandas and Great Expectations.

**Impact:**
Ensures data quality, reduces model training errors, and improves the reliability of predictions.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from implement_rec_001 import ImplementImplementContinuousIntegrationForDataValidation

# Initialize implementation
impl = ImplementImplementContinuousIntegrationForDataValidation()
impl.setup()

# Execute implementation
results = impl.execute()

print(f"Implementation complete: {results}")
```

---

## Architecture

### Implementation Steps

1. Step 1: Install Great Expectations library.
2. Step 2: Define expectations for data schemas, data types, completeness, and range.
3. Step 3: Create a CI pipeline to run validation checks against new data.
4. Step 4: Trigger the CI pipeline on each data ingestion or update.
5. Step 5: Report validation results and fail the pipeline if expectations are not met.

## How This Phase Enables the Simulation Vision

This phase provides critical infrastructure that powers the **hybrid econometric + nonparametric simulation system** described in the [main README](../../../README.md#simulation-methodology).

**What this phase enables:**

### 1. Econometric Causal Inference Foundation

Data collection infrastructure provides raw material for causal inference:

**Panel data structure:**
- **Temporal precision:** Enables within-unit variation analysis (player-game, team-season observations)
- **Longitudinal tracking:** Supports fixed effects models controlling for unobserved heterogeneity
- **Time-varying covariates:** Captures dynamic relationships for panel regression

**Causal identification:**
- **Instrumental variables:** Provides data for IV estimation (draft position, injuries as instruments)
- **Natural experiments:** Collects data around policy changes (rule changes, coaching transitions)
- **Regression discontinuity:** Captures data at cutoffs (playoff thresholds, draft lottery)

**Treatment effect estimation:**
- Propensity score matching: Comparable observations across treatment/control groups
- Difference-in-differences: Pre/post treatment data for causal impact estimation
- Heterogeneous effects: Data stratification for subgroup analysis

### 2. Nonparametric Event Modeling (Distribution-Free)

Raw data enables empirical distribution estimation without parametric assumptions:

**Irregular event frequencies:**
- **Kernel density estimation:** Models technical fouls, coach's challenges, ejections using empirical densities
- **Bootstrap resampling:** Generates injury occurrences by resampling from observed transaction data
- **Empirical CDFs:** Draws flagrant fouls, shot clock violations directly from observed distributions

**Performance variability:**
- **Quantile regression:** Models shooting "hot streaks" with fat-tailed distributions
- **Empirical transition matrices:** Captures make/miss patterns without geometric assumptions
- **Changepoint detection:** Identifies momentum shifts using PELT on play-by-play data

**Distribution-free inference:**
- No parametric assumptions (no Poisson, normal, exponential)
- Directly sample from empirical distributions
- Preserve tail behavior and extreme events

### 3. Context-Adaptive Simulations

Using collected data, simulations adapt to:

**Historical context:**
- Queries team standings at exact date to model "playoff push" vs. "tanking" behavior
- Uses schedule density (back-to-backs, road trips) for fatigue modeling
- Incorporates playoff seeding implications in late-season game intensity

**Player career arcs:**
- Estimates aging curves with player fixed effects + time-varying coefficients
- Models "prime years" vs. "declining phase" using nonlinear age effects
- Tracks skill evolution (3PT%, assist rates) across player development

**Game situation dynamics:**
- Adapts strategy based on real-time score differential
- Incorporates time remaining for late-game adjustments
- Uses momentum detection for psychological effects

### 4. Integration with Main README Methodology

**Panel data regression (Main README: Lines 81-87):**
- Collected data forms player-season, team-game panel structure for econometric analysis

**Nonparametric validation (Main README: Line 116):**
- Collected event frequencies validated using distribution-free tests (K-S, Anderson-Darling)

**Monte Carlo simulation (Main README: Line 119):**
- Collected data provides empirical distributions for Monte Carlo sampling with uncertainty

**See [main README](../../../README.md) for complete methodology.**
