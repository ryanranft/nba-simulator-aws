## Recommendation Details

Use simple random sampling (SRS) to efficiently explore large NBA datasets before applying computationally expensive methods. This allows for quick identification of data quality issues and potential modeling strategies.

---

## Technical Details

Implement SRS using Python's `random.sample` on data stored in AWS S3 or a data warehouse like Snowflake. Use a sampling fraction appropriate for the dataset size (e.g., 1-10%).

---

## Expected Impact

Reduces the time for initial data exploration and allows for easier development and testing of modeling pipelines before scaling up.
