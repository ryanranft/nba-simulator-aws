## Source Information

**Book:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Chapter:** Chapter 2: Regression Models
**Category:** Statistics

---

## Recommendation Details

Use k-fold cross-validation to obtain a more reliable estimate of model performance, especially when dealing with limited datasets. This provides a more robust assessment of model generalization ability.

---

## Technical Details

Use `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score` or `sklearn.model_selection.KFold`. Partition the dataset into k folds and train the model k times, each time using a different fold for testing.

---

## Expected Impact

Provides a more accurate and reliable estimate of model performance, reducing sensitivity to the specific train/test split.

---

## Implementation Priority

**Priority Level:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

---

## Dependencies

**No dependencies identified.**
