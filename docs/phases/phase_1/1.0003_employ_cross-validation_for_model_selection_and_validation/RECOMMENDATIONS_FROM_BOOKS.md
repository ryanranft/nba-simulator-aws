## Recommendation Details

Utilize cross-validation techniques to rigorously validate model performance and select the best model from a set of candidate models. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization to unseen data.

---

## Technical Details

Implement k-fold cross-validation using scikit-learn's `KFold` or `cross_val_score` functions. Use appropriate discrepancy measures (e.g., MSE, log loss) to evaluate model performance.

---

## Expected Impact

Robust model selection and validation, ensuring generalization to new data and improving the reliability of predictions.
