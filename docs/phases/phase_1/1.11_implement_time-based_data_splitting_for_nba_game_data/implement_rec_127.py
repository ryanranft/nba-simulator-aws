Implementation: Implement Time-Based Data Splitting for NBA Game Data

Recommendation ID: rec_127
Source: building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
Priority: CRITICAL

Description:
When creating training, validation, and test sets, use time-based data splitting to prevent data leakage. Specifically, ensure that the test set consists of data from a later time period than the training set.

Expected Impact:
Accurate model evaluation and realistic performance metrics.
