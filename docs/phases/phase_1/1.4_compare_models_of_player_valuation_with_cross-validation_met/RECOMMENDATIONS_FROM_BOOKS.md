## Recommendation Details

For different parameters in the model, evaluate what features lead to certain outcomes. It could be shown with a test set of data what key variables were responsible for a higher or lower team performance.

---

## Technical Details

Set the response variables to be what metric you are analyzing (ie. 'team offensive rating'). Do a similar process to what was down above and test the model on different subsets.
