# Recommendation Status: Implement k-Fold Cross-Validation for Robust Model Evaluation

**ID:** rec_068
**Name:** Implement k-Fold Cross-Validation for Robust Model Evaluation
**Phase:** 1 (Statistics)
**Source Books:** Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Dependencies:** 0 dependencies

---

## Description

Use k-fold cross-validation to obtain a more reliable estimate of model performance, especially when dealing with limited datasets. This provides a more robust assessment of model generalization ability.

---

## Expected Impact

Provides a more accurate and reliable estimate of model performance, reducing sensitivity to the specific train/test split.
