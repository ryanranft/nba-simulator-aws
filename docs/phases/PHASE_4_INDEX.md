## Key Architecture Decisions

**ADRs created in Phase 4:**
- Monte Carlo over deterministic simulation
- 1,000 iterations as default (balance of speed/accuracy)
- Temporal reconstruction using event_time indexes

**See:** `docs/adr/README.md`

## Advanced Simulation Framework (Planned Enhancement)

**Document:** `docs/ADVANCED_SIMULATION_FRAMEWORK.md`

**Econometric models planned:**
1. **ARIMA:** Time-series forecasting for momentum/streaks
2. **VAR:** Multi-variable regression for player interactions
3. **State-Space Models:** Dynamic parameter estimation
4. **Kalman Filters:** Real-time probability updates

**Expected accuracy boost:** 63% â†’ 75-80%

**Timeline:** 20-30 hours additional work

## Multi-Sport Replication

**When adding a new sport (NFL, MLB, NHL, Soccer):**

This phase is **mostly sport-agnostic** - core Monte Carlo framework is reusable:

**Reusable components:**
- Monte Carlo simulation framework
- Temporal state reconstruction pattern
- Win probability calculation logic

**Sport-specific adaptations:**
- Scoring models (touchdowns vs points)
- Game flow parameters (quarters vs innings)
- Win probability curves (sport-specific)

**Example for NFL:**
```python
# Adapt scoring model
def simulate_nfl_drive(field_position, down, distance):
    # NFL-specific drive simulation
    return touchdown, field_goal, punt, turnover

# Win probability for NFL
def nfl_win_prob(score_diff, time_remaining, possessing_team):
    # NFL-specific win probability curve
    return probability
```

## Key Workflows

**For Sub-Phase 4.0:**
- Workflow #5: Task Execution
- Workflow #13: Testing Framework
- Workflow #2: Command Logging

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

1. **Simulations too slow**
   - Solution: Reduce iteration count (1000 â†’ 100 for testing)
   - Or: Parallelize simulations across cores
   - Or: Use NumPy vectorized operations

2. **Temporal queries slow**
   - Solution: Ensure event_time indexed
   - Use materialized views for common queries
   - Cache game states in memory

3. **Inaccurate win probabilities**
   - Solution: Calibrate against historical outcomes
   - Increase training data volume
   - Consider advanced ML models (Phase 5)

4. **Memory errors with large simulations**
   - Solution: Process in batches
   - Use generators instead of lists
   - Run on EC2 with more RAM

**After Phase 4 complete:**
- âœ… Basic simulation engine operational
