## Next Steps

### To Enable Real Predictions (with Trained Model)

1. **Train model with matching features:**
   ```python
   # Use the 1,304 features from prepare_upcoming_game_features.py
   # Train on historical game outcomes with same feature set
   # Save to MLflow or local file
   ```

2. **Run predictions:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/ml/predict_upcoming_games.py --model-run-id <YOUR_MODEL_ID>
   ```

### To Improve Accuracy

1. **Add more features:**
   - Injury reports (ESPN API)
   - Rest days (back-to-back games)
   - Travel distance
   - Head-to-head history

2. **Tune model:**
   - Try different algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest)
   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Feature selection (SHAP, permutation importance)

3. **Validate predictions:**
   - Track prediction accuracy over time
   - Compare to betting market odds
   - Analyze prediction errors

### Production Deployment

1. **Automate daily updates:**
   ```bash
   # Cron job: Run daily at 6 AM
   0 6 * * * /path/to/scripts/ml/generate_daily_predictions.sh
   ```

2. **Add monitoring:**
   - Prediction accuracy tracking
   - Feature drift detection
   - API availability monitoring

3. **Create web interface:**
   - Flask/FastAPI REST API
   - React frontend
   - Real-time updates

## FAQs

### Q: How accurate are the predictions?

**A:** With a properly trained model using panel features, expected accuracy is ~84% (based on panel data integration testing). Current demo mode uses rule-based predictions for demonstration purposes.

### Q: How often should predictions be updated?

**A:** Daily updates recommended, ideally 4-6 hours before game time to capture:
- Latest injury reports
- Updated player performance
- Recent game outcomes

### Q: Can this predict other sports?

**A:** Yes! The architecture is sport-agnostic. Key changes needed:
- Update data sources (API endpoints, S3 paths)
- Adjust features for sport-specific stats
- Retrain model with new sport's data

### Q: What if a player is injured?

**A:** Current system uses recent averages, which naturally downweight missing players. For better accuracy, add injury status as a feature:
- Binary flag: injured/healthy
- Days since return from injury
- Replacement player's stats

### Q: How do I add more games?

**A:** Just change the `--days` parameter:
```bash
python scripts/ml/fetch_upcoming_games.py --days 14  # Next 2 weeks
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No games found

**Cause:** ESPN API returned no scheduled games for date range
**Solution:** Check NBA schedule, try different date range

### Issue: Team roster mapping failed

**Cause:** Team name mismatch between ESPN and hoopR
**Solution:** Update team name mapping in `get_team_roster_mapping()` method

### Issue: Feature mismatch error

**Cause:** Model expects different features than generated
**Solution:** Retrain model with current feature set or regenerate features to match model

### Issue: Prediction accuracy is low

**Cause:** Model needs retraining or more features
**Solution:**
1. Retrain with recent data
2. Add more features (injuries, rest, travel)
3. Try different algorithms
