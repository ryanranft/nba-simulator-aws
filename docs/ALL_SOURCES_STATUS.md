⏸️ **Kaggle:** Ready to download (needs credentials)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (when you wake up):

1. **Check scraper status:**
   ```bash
   tail /tmp/overnight_scrape_main.log
   tail /tmp/remainder_scrape_main.log
   tail /tmp/historical_bref_scrape.log
   ```

2. **Verify S3 uploads:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/basketball_reference/ --recursive | wc -l
   aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/nba_stats_api/ --recursive | wc -l
   ```

3. **Set up Kaggle (optional):**
   - Go to https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account
   - Create API token
   - Save to ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   - Run: `bash scripts/etl/kaggle_download.sh`

4. **Run SportsDataverse (optional):**
   ```bash
   nohup bash -c 'for year in {2007..2025}; do python scripts/etl/scrape_sportsdataverse.py --season $year --upload-to-s3; done' > /tmp/sportsdataverse.log 2>&1 &
   ```

### Future:

**For validation:**
- Compare Basketball Reference vs Kaggle (both 1946-2025)
- Compare NBA Stats vs Kaggle (both 1996-2025)
- Compare ESPN vs SportsDataverse (both ESPN-based)

**For feature engineering:**
- Merge all sources for maximum features (209+)
- Use 1996-2025 as primary ML dataset (all features)
- Use 1946-1992 for historical analysis

## Cost Impact

**Current monthly costs:** $38.33
- S3: $2.74
- RDS: $29.00
- EC2: $6.59

**After all sources:**
- Additional S3 storage: +$0.50 - $1.00/month
- **New total:** ~$39-40/month

**Still well under $150/month budget!** ✅
