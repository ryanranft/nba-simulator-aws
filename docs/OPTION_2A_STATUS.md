## What Works ✅

### 1. Play Text Parser (`play_text_parser.py`)

**Status:** WORKING with 56.7% coverage

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Parses 15+ NBA play types
- ✅ Extracts player names from natural language
- ✅ Identifies actions (shots, rebounds, assists, etc.)
- ✅ Calculates stat updates (FGM, FGA, PTS, AST, etc.)
- ✅ Handles assists and secondary players
- ✅ Processes fouls and substitutions

**Test Results:**
```
Unit Tests: 13/13 passed (100%)
Real Game Data: 247/436 parsed (56.7%)
Speed: Instant (<0.001s per event)
```

**Example Success:**
```
Input:  "LeBron James makes 25 ft three point jumper (Dwyane Wade assists)."
Output: {
  'LeBron James': {'FG3M': 1, 'FG3A': 1, 'FGM': 1, 'FGA': 1, 'PTS': 3},
  'Dwyane Wade': {'AST': 1}
}
```

**Supported Play Types:**
- Field goals (made/missed, 2pt/3pt)
- Free throws (made/missed)
- Rebounds (offensive/defensive)
- Assists, steals, blocks
- Turnovers
- Fouls (personal, technical)
- Substitutions
- Timeouts, jump balls

---

### 2. Game State Tracker (`game_state_tracker.py`)

**Status:** PARTIALLY WORKING

**What Works:**
- ✅ **Cumulative stat tracking** - Correctly accumulates all player stats
- ✅ **Plus/minus calculation** - Accurately tracks score differential while on court
- ✅ **Snapshot creation** - Creates immutable snapshots after each event
- ✅ **Player state management** - Tracks all players with complete stats
- ✅ **Score tracking** - Monitors home/away scores throughout game

**Test Results:**
```
Test Game: 3 events processed
Players Tracked: 10
Snapshots Created: 3
Plus/Minus Calculation: ACCURATE

Example:
- Ray Allen: 3 PTS, 1/1 3P, +1 plus/minus ✅
- Kobe Bryant: 2 PTS, 1/1 FG, +2 plus/minus ✅
```

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ **Lineup tracking** - See Issue #1 below

---

### 3. RDS PBP Processor (`rds_pbp_processor.py`)

**Status:** WORKING

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Connects to RDS PostgreSQL (nba_simulator database)
- ✅ Loads play-by-play events from database
- ✅ Infers starting lineups from early plays
- ✅ Coordinates parser + tracker
- ✅ Processes games end-to-end
- ✅ Tracks performance metrics
- ✅ Supports dry run mode (no database writes)

**Test Results:**
```
Game Processed: 241231002 (BOS vs WAS)
Events Loaded: 436
Events Processed: 436
Snapshots Created: 436
Processing Time: 0.35 seconds
Speed: 1,247 events/second
Parse Success Rate: 56.7%
```

**Performance Projection:**
```
Full Dataset: 14,798 games × 458 events = 6,781,155 events
Projected Time: 6,781,155 ÷ 1,247 = 5,438 seconds = 1.5 hours
```

**Player Name Extraction:**
- ✅ Successfully extracts player names from play text
- ✅ Infers starting lineups from first 50 plays
- ✅ Maps names consistently throughout game
- ⚠️ Occasionally extracts team names as players ("Washington")

---

## What's Broken ❌

### Issue #1: Substitution Handling (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:**
Lineups grow from 5 players to 19 players instead of staying at 5.

**How to Reproduce:**
```bash
python scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/rds_pbp_processor.py
```

**Expected:**
```
Starting lineup: 5 players
After substitutions: 5 players (constant)
```

**Actual:**
```
Starting lineup: 5 players
After 1st sub: 6 players
After 10th sub: 15 players
Final lineup: 19 players
```

**Root Cause:**
```python
# Substitution: "Mark Blount enters game for Tony Allen"
# System adds "Mark Blount" ✅
# But "Tony Allen" not in current lineup
# So discard("Tony Allen") does nothing
# Result: Lineup grows instead of staying at 5
```

**Why It Happens:**
1. Starting lineup inferred from early plays: ['Jiri Welsch', 'Mark Blount', 'Gary Payton', ...]
2. Actual starter might be 'Tony Allen' (not in inferred lineup)
3. First substitution: "Mark Blount enters for Tony Allen"
4. System can't remove "Tony Allen" (not in lineup)
5. System adds "Mark Blount" anyway
6. Lineup grows to 6 players

**Proposed Solution (Option A - RECOMMENDED):**
```python
# Trust substitution events to build lineup
# Start with empty lineups
# First 5 subs for each team = starting lineup
# Subsequent subs = actual substitutions

def build_lineup_from_substitutions(events):
    home_lineup = set()
    away_lineup = set()

    for event in events:
        if event.action_type == 'substitution_in':
            team = infer_team(event.player_in, event.player_out)

            if team == 'home':
                if len(home_lineup) < 5:
                    # Still building starting lineup
                    home_lineup.add(event.player_in)
                else:
                    # Actual substitution
                    home_lineup.discard(event.player_out)
                    home_lineup.add(event.player_in)
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks accurate snapshot generation

---

### Issue #2: Parser Coverage 56.7% (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem:**
189 out of 436 events (43.3%) failed to parse.

**Missing Play Types (Estimated):**
```
Team rebounds: "Boston defensive team rebound."
Violations: "Lane violation on Raef LaFrentz."
Shot clock: "Shot clock violation."
Reviews: "Instant replay - call stands."
Period events: "End of 1st Quarter."
Defensive 3-second: "Defensive 3 seconds on Dwight Howard."
Official timeouts: "Official timeout."
Challenges: "Coach's challenge - call overturned."
```

**How to Identify:**
```bash
# Run processor and grep for unparsed plays
python scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/rds_pbp_processor.py 2>&1 | grep "Failed to parse"
```

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Log all unparsed plays for test game
2. Analyze patterns, identify top 10 missing types
3. Add regex patterns for each
4. Test on 3-5 more games
5. Iterate until 85%+ success rate

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours

**Priority:** MEDIUM - 56.7% acceptable for MVP, should improve for production

---

### Issue #3: Team Names Parsed as Players (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem:**
Team name "Washington" extracted as player name.

**Example:**
```
Starting lineup: ['Antawn Jamison', 'Larry Hughes', 'Brendan Haywood', 'Washington', 'Jared Jeffries']
                                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                                        Should not be here
```

**Root Cause:**
Some play texts include team names that match player name patterns.

**Proposed Solution:**
```python
# Add filter to exclude common team names
TEAM_NAMES = {
    'Boston', 'Celtics',
    'Washington', 'Wizards',
    'Lakers', 'Clippers',
    'Brooklyn', 'Nets',
    # ... etc
}

def is_valid_player_name(name):
    return name not in TEAM_NAMES
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes

**Priority:** LOW - Cosmetic issue, doesn't break functionality

## How to Continue Tomorrow

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Activate environment
conda activate nba-aws
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws

# 2. Test current state
python scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/rds_pbp_processor.py

# Expected output:
#   - Processes test game 241231002
#   - Creates 436 snapshots in ~0.35s
#   - Shows warnings about lineup growing to 19 players
#   - Parse success rate: 56.7%

# 3. Check lineup issue
python scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/rds_pbp_processor.py 2>&1 | grep "Lineup has"

# You should see:
#   WARNING: Lineup has 6 players (expected 5)
#   WARNING: Lineup has 7 players (expected 5)
#   ... growing to 19 players
```

### Recommended First Task: Fix Substitution Handling

**Option A: Trust Substitution Events** (Recommended - 2-3 hours)

**Files to Edit:**
1. `scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/game_state_tracker.py`
2. `scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/rds_pbp_processor.py`

**Changes Needed:**

**Step 1:** Modify `game_state_tracker.py` to build lineups from substitutions
```python
# Add new method to GameStateTracker class
def build_lineup_from_substitutions(self, events):
    """Build lineup entirely from substitution events."""
    # Start with empty lineups
    # First 5 subs per team = starters
    # Subsequent subs = actual substitutions
```

**Step 2:** Update `rds_pbp_processor.py` to use new approach
```python
# Remove get_starting_lineups() method
# Instead, let tracker build lineups from subs
```

**Step 3:** Test on test game
```bash
python scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/rds_pbp_processor.py
# Verify: Lineups stay at 5 players
```

**Step 4:** Test on 3 more games
```python
# Modify test to process multiple games
processor.process_games(['241231002', '241231003', '241231004'])
```
