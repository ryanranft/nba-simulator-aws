# NBA Data Sources - Multi-Source Strategy

**Last Updated:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** Active - 5 sources configured

---

## Overview

This project uses a **multi-source data strategy** to ensure data quality, completeness, and redundancy. Each source serves a specific purpose and fills gaps in the others.

**Philosophy:**
- **Primary source:** ESPN (already uploaded to S3, 1999-2025)
- **Verification sources:** 4 additional sources for cross-validation and gap-filling
- **Goal:** Achieve 95%+ data completeness and accuracy

## Multi-Source Strategy

### Data Flow

```
1. Primary Source (ESPN)
   ‚Üì
2. Upload to S3
   ‚Üì
3. Extract to RDS (Phase 2)
   ‚Üì
4. Verification (Phases to be created)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí NBA.com Stats (scores, official IDs)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Kaggle DB (historical validation)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí SportsDataverse (cross-check)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Basketball Reference (advanced stats)
   ‚Üì
5. Discrepancy Resolution
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Flag conflicts
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Log to database table
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Manual review or auto-fix
   ‚Üì
6. Final Clean Dataset
```

### Verification Workflow

**For each game in RDS:**

1. **Check completeness:**
   - All required fields present?
   - Game date valid?
   - Scores > 0?

2. **Cross-validate with NBA.com Stats:**
   - Scores match?
   - Date/time match?
   - Team IDs match?

3. **Fill gaps from other sources:**
   - Missing advanced stats ‚Üí Basketball Reference
   - Historical games (pre-1999) ‚Üí Kaggle DB or Basketball Reference
   - Player metadata ‚Üí SportsDataverse

4. **Log discrepancies:**
   - Create `data_quality_log` table in RDS
   - Store: game_id, field, source1_value, source2_value, severity, resolved

5. **Auto-fix or manual review:**
   - Low severity: Auto-fix (e.g., formatting)
   - Medium severity: Flag for review
   - High severity: Block game from use until resolved
