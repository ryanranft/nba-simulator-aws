# Real NBA Data Validation - Progress Report

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Task:** Validate panel data framework (rec_22 + rec_11) with real NBA data

## Status: IN PROGRESS (3 of 6 tasks complete)

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Load Real NBA Player Game Stats
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Data Source:** `s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/hoopr_parquet/player_box/`

**Results:**
- Years loaded: 2018-2021
- Player-game observations: 126,267
- Unique players: 898
- Unique games: 4,936
- Date range: 2017-10-17 to 2021-07-20

**Key Findings:**
- Hoopr data contains comprehensive player box scores
- Includes all required fields: points, rebounds, assists, FG%, etc.
- Has `game_date_time` for temporal queries (perfect!)

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Run Panel Data Pipeline
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. Created panel index with multi-index (player_id, game_id, timestamp)
2. Generated 149 panel data features using rec_22:
   - Lag variables: 5 lags √ó 10 stats = 50 features
   - Rolling windows: 8 windows √ó 10 stats = 80 features  
   - Original features: 19

**Processing Time:** ~2-3 minutes for 126K observations

**Key Findings:**
- Panel data structure works perfectly with real NBA data
- Feature generation completed without errors
- Performance warnings about DataFrame fragmentation (expected, not critical)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 3: Validate 68-71% Accuracy
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Current Results:**
- Best Test Accuracy: 54.4% (Logistic Regression)
- Baseline (16 features): 63.0%
- Target (panel features): 68-71%
- **Gap: -8.6% from baseline, -13.6% from target**

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The issue is in the aggregation step:
- Player-level features: 149
- Game-level features after aggregation: **14** 
- **Lost 135 features** in aggregation!

**Current Aggregation (too simple):**
```python
game_features = df_panel_flat.groupby('game_id').agg({
    'points': ['mean', 'std', 'max', 'sum'],      # 4 features
    'rebounds': ['mean', 'std', 'max'],           # 3 features
    'assists': ['mean', 'std', 'max'],            # 3 features
    'fg_pct': 'mean',                              # 1 feature
    'three_pct': 'mean',                           # 1 feature
    'ft_pct': 'mean',                              # 1 feature
    'minutes': 'sum'                               # 1 feature
})
# Total: 14 features
```

**Missing Features:**
- All lag variables (50 features)
- All rolling window stats (80 features)
- Temporal trends, cumulative stats, etc.

**Solution Required:**
Need to aggregate ALL 149 player-level features to game level by:
1. Taking team-level aggregations (mean, std, max, min, sum)
2. Separating home/away team features
3. Creating matchup features (team A stats - team B stats)

**Example Proper Aggregation:**
```python
# For each of 149 features, create:
- home_team_mean
- away_team_mean
- home_team_std
- away_team_std
- home_minus_away

# Result: 149 √ó 5 = 745 game-level features
```

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Task 4: Fix Feature Aggregation
**Status:** PENDING

**Plan:**
1. Separate home/away teams for each game
2. Aggregate all 149 features per team
3. Create matchup features
4. Re-train models
5. Validate 68-71% target

**Expected Outcome:** With proper feature aggregation, we should reach 68-71% accuracy.

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Task 5: Test Temporal Queries
**Status:** PENDING

**Plan:**
- Query player career stats at specific game timestamps
- Validate millisecond precision
- Test cumulative statistics accuracy

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Task 6: Document Performance
**Status:** PENDING

**Metrics to Document:**
- Final accuracy (target: 68-71%)
- Processing time vs synthetic data
- Feature engineering effectiveness
- Real vs synthetic data comparison

    ‚Üì
149 player-level features
    ‚Üì
Aggregate to Game Level [‚Üê ISSUE HERE]
    ‚Üì

    ‚Üì
54.4% accuracy (BELOW TARGET)
```

### Models Tested:
1. Logistic Regression: 54.4% (best)
2. Random Forest: 51.2%
3. XGBoost: 50.7%
4. LightGBM: 49.1%

All models showing overfitting (100% train, ~50% test) due to insufficient features.

## Next Session Tasks

1. **Fix aggregation script** to properly convert 149 player features ‚Üí game features
2. **Re-train models** with full feature set
3. **Validate 68-71% accuracy** target
4. **Test temporal queries** on real timestamps
5. **Document final results**

## Files Created This Session

1. `/scripts/ml/train_with_real_nba_data.py` - Panel data extraction
2. `/scripts/ml/train_with_real_nba_features.py` - Model training
3. `/tmp/real_nba_game_features.parquet` - Intermediate features

## Key Insights

1. ‚úÖ **Panel data framework works with real NBA data** - no structural issues
2. ‚úÖ **Feature generation is robust** - handled 126K observations successfully  
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Aggregation needs improvement** - must preserve all engineered features
4. üìä **Real NBA data is harder than synthetic** - 54% vs 100% (expected)

## Estimated Time to Complete

- Fix aggregation: 30-60 minutes
- Re-train & validate: 15-30 minutes
- Temporal query testing: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 30 minutes

**Total: 2-3 hours**
