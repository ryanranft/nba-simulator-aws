# Session Initialization

This document contains detailed procedures and decision criteria for starting Claude Code sessions.

## Session Startup Protocol (Proactive)

### 1. Always Run at Start of Each Session

**Credentials:** Auto-loaded from ~/.zshrc when entering project directory (no verification needed)

**Startup checklist** - Automatically run (don't ask user, just do it):

```bash
source scripts/shell/session_manager.sh start
```

**What it checks:**
- Hardware: Model, Chip, Cores, Memory
- System: macOS version, Homebrew version and location
- Conda: Version, base path, active environment
- Python: Version, location, key packages (boto3, pandas, numpy) with install paths
- AWS CLI: Version and location
- Git: Version, location, status (branch, modified/untracked files), recent commits
- **Documentation status:** FILE_INVENTORY.md age, session history, command log, PROGRESS.md tasks, stale docs
- **Conversation logging:** Offers terminal session logging setup
- **Command logging:** Auto-sources log_command.sh functions

**Output format:** Clean, organized sections with all diagnostic details preserved

**Session start:** Show output to user for review

**After EVERY commit:** Append to `.session-history.md` with:
```bash
bash scripts/shell/session_manager.sh start >> .session-history.md
```
This creates a version snapshot for each commit, allowing user to correlate git history with exact software versions used

**Check conversation status:**
- If CHAT_LOG.md exists and is stale (>30 min): Remind user it will be overwritten at 75% context
- If context approaching 75%: Proactively mention auto-save is coming soon
- CHAT_LOG.md is auto-managed - no user action needed

**Initial orientation:**
- Identify current phase from PROGRESS.md
- Review documentation status warnings from `session_manager.sh start` output
- Ask: "Any work completed since last session that should be marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE in PROGRESS.md?"

### 2. Ask User If They Want to Run (Based on Time Since Last Update)

- If Monday or 7+ days since last update: "Would you like me to run `make update-docs` for weekly maintenance?"
- If 7+ days since last inventory: "Should I run `make inventory` to update file summaries?"
- If new AWS resources may exist: "Should I run `make sync-progress` to check if PROGRESS.md matches AWS?"
- If any .md files modified: "After these changes, should I run `make inventory` to update FILE_INVENTORY.md?"

## File Inventory & Documentation (CRITICAL - Do Automatically)

### ALWAYS Update FILE_INVENTORY.md When Creating/Modifying Files

**Before `git add .`:** Run `make inventory` to update FILE_INVENTORY.md with new/changed files

**After running `make inventory`:** Review git diff to see what files changed, then document:
- **What you created/modified:** List each file path
- **Why you made the change:** Purpose and problem being solved
- **What error you were resolving:** If fixing a bug, document the error

**Format for documentation:**

```markdown
## File Changes - [Date] [Brief Description]

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `path/to/file1.py` - Purpose: Created X function to solve Y problem
- `path/to/file2.md` - Purpose: Documented Z decision (ADR-00X)
- `scripts/shell/file3.sh` - Purpose: Automated W task

**Problem/Error Being Resolved:**
- Error message: [actual error if applicable]
- Root cause: [why it was happening]
- Solution approach: [how files address it]

**Changes Made:**
1. File1: Added/modified X (lines 10-50)
2. File2: Updated Y section with Z information
3. File3: Created new script to automate W
```

**Where to document:** Add to COMMAND_LOG.md (for code changes) and ensure FILE_INVENTORY.md is updated

### Workflow

1. Create/modify files
2. Run `make inventory` (updates FILE_INVENTORY.md automatically)
3. Run `git status` to see all changes
4. Document in COMMAND_LOG.md what you changed and why
5. Then `git add .` and commit

## Check for Stale Documentation Needing Manual Updates

### PROGRESS.md Phase Status

If current phase completed but still shows ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING ‚Üí suggest updating status to ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### PROGRESS.md Cost Estimates

After creating AWS resources ‚Üí ask "Should I run `make check-costs` and update PROGRESS.md with actual costs?"

### TROUBLESHOOTING.md

After solving new error ‚Üí ask "Should I add this solution to TROUBLESHOOTING.md?"

**When to add to TROUBLESHOOTING.md:**
- ‚úÖ Errors that took >10 minutes to solve
- ‚úÖ Non-obvious solutions (wouldn't find with quick Google search)
- ‚úÖ Environment-specific issues (conda, AWS, macOS-specific)
- ‚úÖ Recurring errors (seen multiple times in session)
- ‚úÖ Errors with misleading messages (actual cause different from error text)

**When NOT to add:**
- ‚ùå Typos or syntax errors (obvious from error message)
- ‚ùå One-time issues (unlikely to recur)
- ‚ùå Already documented in official docs

### ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

After architectural decision ‚Üí ask "Should I create ADR-00X for this decision? (see docs/adr/template.md)"

**When to create ADRs:**
- ‚úÖ Significant architectural decisions (database choice, service selection, framework adoption)
- ‚úÖ Technology choices with long-term impact (Python version, AWS service vs self-hosted)
- ‚úÖ Major trade-offs (cost vs performance, simplicity vs scalability, storage vs compute)
- ‚úÖ Decisions affecting multiple parts of system (authentication method, logging strategy, error handling)
- ‚úÖ Rejecting common approaches (why NOT using X, why avoiding Y)
- ‚úÖ Development workflow changes (build process, deployment strategy, testing approach)

**When NOT to create ADRs:**
- ‚ùå Small implementation details (variable naming, file organization)
- ‚ùå Temporary workarounds (quick fixes, patches)
- ‚ùå Obvious choices with no alternatives (using JSON for config, Git for version control)
- ‚ùå Easily reversible decisions with no consequences (UI colors, log message format)

### QUICKSTART.md

If workflow changed ‚Üí ask "Should we update QUICKSTART.md with these new commands?"

**When to update QUICKSTART.md:**
- ‚úÖ New daily commands added (scripts, make targets, common operations)
- ‚úÖ File locations changed (moved scripts, reorganized directories)
- ‚úÖ Workflow shortcuts discovered (aliases, one-liners that save time)
- ‚úÖ Common troubleshooting steps identified (frequently used fixes)

**When NOT to update:**
- ‚ùå Rarely-used commands (less than weekly usage)
- ‚ùå One-time setup steps (belongs in docs/SETUP.md instead)
- ‚ùå Experimental commands (not proven yet)

### STYLE_GUIDE.md

If code style preference emerges ‚Üí ask "Should we document this style preference in STYLE_GUIDE.md?"

**When to update STYLE_GUIDE.md:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent pattern used 3+ times (establishes precedent)
- ‚úÖ Readability improvements (type hints, docstring formats)
- ‚úÖ Team conventions (naming patterns, file structure)
- ‚úÖ Language-specific best practices (Python PEP 8, SQL style)
- ‚úÖ Code organization principles (module structure, import order)

**When NOT to update:**
- ‚ùå Personal preferences without rationale
- ‚ùå One-off exceptions (context-specific choices)
- ‚ùå Already covered in official language guides

## Session End Reminders

Remind user at end of session:
- If COMMAND_LOG.md was modified: "Remember to review COMMAND_LOG.md for sensitive data before committing"
- If multiple files changed: "Consider running `make backup` to create a backup"
- If documentation changed: "Consider running `make inventory` to update file summaries"
- If phase completed: "Phase complete! Update PROGRESS.md status to ‚úÖ COMPLETE and run `make sync-progress`"

## Progress Tracking Protocol

### Always Read PROGRESS.md First

Understand what has been completed and what's next

### Follow PROGRESS.md Sequentially

Start from the first "‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING" or "‚è≥ IN PROGRESS" task

### If the Plan Changes

Update PROGRESS.md BEFORE proceeding with new work:
- Document what changed and why
- Update task descriptions, time estimates, or dependencies
- Add new tasks or remove obsolete ones
- Mark changed sections with date and reason
- Get user confirmation before proceeding with the updated plan

### Mark Tasks as Complete Only When:

- Terminal output showing successful execution (exit code 0, expected output), AND
- Either: User says "done", "complete", "looks good", or similar affirmation
- OR: User proceeds to ask about the next task (implicit confirmation)
- **Exception:** Minor tasks (<5 min) can be auto-marked if command succeeds with clear success output

### Do NOT Assume Completion

Even if a command runs without errors, wait for user confirmation

### Update PROGRESS.md Immediately

After each completed step

### If Errors Occur

Document them in PROGRESS.md and work with user to resolve before proceeding

### Maintain Format and Detail Level

When updating PROGRESS.md

## Update PROGRESS.md When

- ‚úÖ Completing any phase or sub-phase
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Discovering blockers or missing prerequisites
- üìù Changing approach or architecture
- ‚ùå Encountering errors that delay timeline
- ‚úÖ User explicitly confirms task completion
- üí∞ Actual costs differ significantly from estimates

## Proactively Suggest Running Maintenance Tasks When

- **After completing a phase:** "Phase X.Y complete! Should I run `make sync-progress` to verify AWS resources match PROGRESS.md?"
- **After creating/modifying scripts:** "New scripts created. Should I run `make inventory` to update FILE_INVENTORY.md?"
- **After solving a new error:** "This error isn't in TROUBLESHOOTING.md yet. Should I add it? (Then run `make inventory`)"
- **After making architectural decisions:** "Should I create an ADR for this decision? (See docs/adr/template.md)"
- **After creating AWS resources:** "New AWS resources created. Should I run `make check-costs` to see the cost impact?"
- **Monday morning or start of week:** "It's a new week! Should I run `make update-docs` for weekly maintenance?"
- **After 5+ commits:** "Several commits made. Should I run `make backup` to create a backup?"

## Error Handling Protocol

- If a command fails, STOP and report to user immediately
- Do NOT attempt multiple fixes without user guidance
- Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for known solutions first
- If unknown error, log with `log_solution` after resolving
- Update PROGRESS.md with error details and resolution

## Context Awareness

- Check what phase we're in before suggesting commands
- Don't suggest Phase 3 commands if Phase 2 isn't complete
- Verify prerequisites exist before executing dependent tasks
- Use `python scripts/maintenance/sync_progress.py` if unsure of current state

## Your Workflow Should Be

1. Read PROGRESS.md to understand current state
2. **If user requests changes to the plan**: Update PROGRESS.md first, get confirmation, then proceed
3. Execute the next pending task
4. Wait for confirmation (terminal output or user saying "done")
5. Update PROGRESS.md to mark task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
6. Move to next task

## Command Logging & Code Snippet Tracking

**CRITICAL: Log ALL code changes and outcomes to COMMAND_LOG.md for learning and reference**

### When Writing/Editing Code Files

Manually document in COMMAND_LOG.md:
- **What you created/changed:** File path, function/class name, purpose
- **Code snippet:** The actual code written (if short) or summary (if long)
- **Outcome:** Did it work? Any errors? What was learned?

**Format:**

```markdown
## [Timestamp] Code Change: [Brief Description]
**File:** `path/to/file.py`
**Purpose:** What this code does and why

**Code:**
```python
# Actual code snippet or summary
```

**Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Success / ‚ùå Failed
- Error messages (if any)
- What worked / what didn't
- Lessons learned
```

**When to log:**
- ‚úÖ New functions/classes created
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes (what was broken, how you fixed it)
- ‚úÖ Refactoring (what changed, why)
- ‚úÖ Failed attempts (what didn't work, why)
- ‚úÖ Performance improvements

**Why this matters:**
- Learn from past mistakes (avoid repeating failed approaches)
- Track what patterns work well in this codebase
- Build institutional knowledge of trial and error
- Reference successful solutions for similar problems

### When Executing Terminal Commands

Encourage user to use the command logging system:
- Source the logging script: `source scripts/shell/log_command.sh`
- Execute commands with: `log_cmd <command>`
- Example: `log_cmd aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/`

### Reference COMMAND_LOG.md When Debugging

Learn from past solutions:
- **Before writing new code:** Check if similar code was written before
- **When errors occur:** Search for similar error messages in log
- **When choosing approaches:** Review what worked/failed previously
- Use as a learning database of what works in this project

### Add Solutions to Errors

Use `log_solution <description>` helper function

### CRITICAL - Before Committing COMMAND_LOG.md to Git

- Always review for sensitive information (credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Sanitize AWS account IDs if sharing publicly
- Replace sensitive IPs/endpoints with placeholders
- Remove or redact any Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- Remind user to review before any `git add` or `git commit` that includes COMMAND_LOG.md
