# Session Handoff - October 7, 2025 (Evening)

## Session Focus
Score tracking bug in possession panel + local PostgreSQL setup for fast iteration

## Completed This Session

### 1. Local Development Environment ✅
- **PostgreSQL 15** running locally at `localhost:5432`
- **Database:** `nba_simulator`
- **Performance:** 10-50x faster than RDS (3 min vs 68 min for 13.6M events)

### 2. Data Loaded Locally ✅
- **Kaggle temporal events:** 13,592,899 events
- **Games metadata:** 65,642 games
- **Data source:** `/tmp/temporal_data_kaggle/`

### 3. Score Tracking Bug - FIXED ✅

**Symptom (Before Fix):**
- 490/493 possessions show 0 points (99.4%)
- 3 possessions show impossible scores (73, 80, 101 points)
- Expected: ~50% with 0, ~35% with 2, ~12% with 3 points

**Root Cause (ESPN data):**
First possession gets `start_score = (0, 0)` but `end_score = (73, 60)` → calculates 73 points instead of 0-3.

**Root Cause (Kaggle data):**
Kaggle stores scores as strings: "9 - 6" (home - away)
The Kaggle possession script was trying to access non-existent `homeScore`/`awayScore` fields.

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Score parsing** (lines 266-279 in `create_possession_panel_from_kaggle.py`):
   - Parse "X - Y" string format from `event_data['score']`
   - Extract home_score and away_score as integers
   - Handle missing/invalid scores gracefully

2. **Column filtering** (lines 535-546):
   - Query database schema dynamically using `information_schema.columns`
   - Filter DataFrame to only include columns that exist in database
   - Prevents "column does not exist" errors

**Results (After Fix):**
- **50 games tested:** Realistic point distribution
  - 0 points: 24/50 (48%) ✅
  - 2 points: 23/50 (46%) ✅
  - 3 points: 2/50 (4%) ✅ (expected lower in 1996 data)
  - 1 point: 1/50 (2%) ✅
- **No cumulative scores** (all possessions show 0-3 points)
- **Fast local testing:** 50 games processed in 2 seconds

## Current Files

### Modified:
1. `scripts/etl/create_possession_panel_from_espn.py`
   - Added debug logging lines 365-366, 386-387
   - Attempted fix with `end_score` parameter (still buggy)

2. `scripts/etl/create_possession_panel_from_kaggle.py`
   - Fixed credentials validation (line 608)
   - Ready for testing but needs score parsing fix

3. `scripts/db/load_kaggle_to_local_postgres.py`
   - Fixed StringIO buffer issue
   - Fixed column mapping for all 10 CSV columns
   - Successfully loaded 13.6M events

### Created:
- `ALTER TABLE` added `player_id`, `precision_level`, `event_type` columns to local `temporal_events`

## Key Insights

### Kaggle Data Structure
```sql
-- Score format: "9 - 6" (string, not tuple)
-- Team IDs: "1610612738.0" (float stored as string)
-- Event types: period_start, jump_ball, made_shot, missed_shot, free_throw, turnover, rebound, foul
```

### Score Tracking Logic (Current - BUGGY)
```python
# Line 286 in ESPN script
end_score=curr_score  # Score AFTER possession ended

# Line 298
start_score=curr_score  # For NEXT possession

# Line 362
score_change = (end_score[0] - start_score[0], end_score[1] - start_score[1])

# Problem: First possession has start=(0,0), end=(cumulative)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session):

1. **Apply Same Fix to ESPN Script** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
   - ESPN script (`create_possession_panel_from_espn.py`) still has the score tracking bug
   - Consider consolidating the two scripts to avoid code duplication
   - Or copy the column filtering logic from Kaggle script

2. **Test ESPN Script Locally**
   - Verify ESPN data also produces realistic point distributions
   - Compare ESPN vs Kaggle possession detection accuracy

3. **Scale Up Kaggle Processing** (Optional)
   - Current: 50 games in 2 seconds
   - Could process all 65,642 games in ~40 minutes locally
   - Consider running overnight to build full possession panel

### Deferred:

- RDS Kaggle load (failed due to NULL `wall_clock_utc` - needs data cleaning)
- Full RDS deployment (local testing working great)
- Migration to AWS (local testing first)

## Database State

### Local PostgreSQL:
```
temporal_events: 13,592,899 rows (Kaggle)
games: 65,642 rows
possession_panel: 0 rows (truncated for testing)
```

### RDS:
```
temporal_events: 14,117,466 rows (ESPN only)
games: exists but not queried
possession_panel: 493 rows (buggy - from previous session)
```

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate nba-aws
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws

# Check local data
psql -d nba_simulator -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM temporal_events WHERE data_source = 'kaggle';"

# Test possession panel (local - FAST)
python scripts/etl/create_possession_panel_from_kaggle.py --limit 10

# Verify results
psql -d nba_simulator -c "
SELECT
  points_scored,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 1) as pct
FROM possession_panel
GROUP BY points_scored
ORDER BY points_scored;
"
```

## Context Usage

This session: ~130K/200K tokens (65% used)
- Lots of file reading for debugging
- Multiple parallel background jobs from previous session
- Extensive data exploration

## Files to Read Next Session

1. `scripts/etl/create_possession_panel_from_kaggle.py` (focus on score parsing logic)
2. `scripts/etl/create_possession_panel_from_espn.py` (reference for comparison)
3. This handoff document
