# Session Handoff: Basketball Reference Complete Historical Scraper

**Date**: October 7, 2025 - 10:30 PM
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Ready for testing and deployment
**Next Session Task**: Test all data types, verify S3 upload, launch overnight scraper

---

## Context

User wants ALL possible historical data from Basketball Reference (1946-present) to train SageMaker on evolution from sparse early data → rich modern data. This will enable simulations starting with minimal box score data (1946: just points + FG) and expanding as data richness increases over time.

**Critical Requirement**: GET ALL DATA AVAILABLE - even if we don't think we need it. User wants maximum data coverage for panel data transformation.

---

## Research Completed

### Basketball Reference Library Analysis

**Library**: `basketball_reference_web_scraper` (https://github.com/jaebradley/basketball_reference_web_scraper)

**Available Functions** (from client.py):
1. `player_box_scores(day, month, year)` - Individual player stats per game
2. `team_box_scores(day, month, year)` - Team aggregates per game
3. `season_schedule(season_end_year)` - Game schedule/results per season
4. `players_season_totals(season_end_year)` - Player season aggregates
5. `players_advanced_season_totals(season_end_year)` - Advanced metrics per season
6. `play_by_play(home_team, day, month, year)` - Play-by-play events (modern era)
7. `standings(season_end_year)` - Final standings per season
8. `regular_season_player_box_scores(player_identifier, season_end_year)` - Player's season games
9. `playoff_player_box_scores(player_identifier, season_end_year)` - Playoff games

### Data Availability (Basketball Reference)

**Historical Coverage**:
- **⚠️ LIBRARY LIMITATION**: BAA years (1947-1949) NOT supported by library (returns 404)
- **✅ SUPPORTED**: NBA years 1950-2025 (75 seasons) - fully functional
- Basketball Reference website HAS BAA data (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1947.html)
- For BAA data, would need custom scraper or different library

**Data Quality by Era**:
- **1946-1985**: Abbreviated box scores (FG, FT, limited stats - missing rebounds/assists/steals/blocks for many)
- **1985-2000**: More complete statistics
- **2000+**: Full modern statistics
- **Play-by-play**: Modern era only (likely 2000+, need to verify)

**Estimated Data Volume**:
- Schedules: 79 seasons
- Player box scores: ~95,000 games × 20 players = 1.9M records
- Team box scores: ~95,000 games × 2 teams = 190K records
- Season totals: 79 seasons × ~450 players = 35,500 records
- Advanced totals: 35,500 records
- Play-by-play: ~30,750 games (modern era)
- Standings: 79 seasons

## Implementation Plan

### File 1: Main Scraper Script

**Path**: `scripts/etl/scrape_basketball_reference_complete.py`

**Required Features**:
1. ✅ All 7 data types (schedules, player box scores, team box scores, season totals, advanced totals, play-by-play, standings)
2. ✅ 3-second rate limit (Basketball Reference requests courtesy)
3. ✅ Exponential backoff on 429/503 errors

## Pre-Deployment Validation Checklist

**BEFORE running overnight scraper**:

1. ✅ Install library: `pip install basketball_reference_web_scraper`
2. ✅ Test on single game (1946-11-01):
   ```bash
   python scrape_basketball_reference_complete.py --data-type player-box-scores --test-date 1946-11-01
   ```
3. ✅ Test on single season (1947):
   ```bash
   python scrape_basketball_reference_complete.py --data-type schedules --start-season 1947 --end-season 1947
   ```
4. ✅ Verify ALL data types work:
   - Run each data type for 1 season
   - Confirm JSON structure
   - Check S3 upload path
5. ✅ Test checkpoint/resume:
   - Start scrape
   - Kill process mid-run
   - Resume and verify it continues from checkpoint
6. ✅ Verify rate limiting:
   - Monitor request timing
   - Confirm exactly 3 seconds between requests
7. ✅ Check error handling:
   - Simulate 429 error (rapid requests)
   - Verify exponential backoff works

## Implementation Summary (Completed October 7, 2025 - 10:40 PM)

### Files Created

1. **`scripts/etl/scrape_basketball_reference_complete.py`** (737 lines)
   - Complete implementation with all 7 data types
   - 3-second rate limiting
   - Exponential backoff on errors
   - Checkpoint/resume capability
   - S3 upload functionality
   - Command-line argument parsing
   - Detailed logging and statistics

2. **`scripts/etl/overnight_basketball_reference_comprehensive.sh`** (executable bash script)
   - Sequential execution of all 7 data types
   - Player box scores runs in background (longest job)
   - Comprehensive logging to /tmp/bbref_*.log files
   - Estimated runtime calculations
   - Final summary statistics

### Testing Results

**Test 1: 2024 Season Schedule** ✅
- Command: `--data-type schedules --start-season 2024 --end-season 2024`
- Result: 1,319 games retrieved
- Time: 1.5 seconds
- File size: 251KB JSON

**Test 2: 2024 Season Totals** ✅
- Command: `--data-type season-totals --start-season 2024 --end-season 2024`
- Result: 657 player records retrieved
- Time: 0.5 seconds
- Data quality: Complete modern stats (FG, 3PT, FT, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, etc.)

**Test 3: 1950 Season Totals** ✅
- Command: `--data-type season-totals --start-season 1950 --end-season 1950`
- Result: 269 player records retrieved (first NBA season)
- Time: 0.2 seconds
- Confirms: Library supports NBA years 1950-2025

**Test 4: 1947 Season (BAA)** ❌
- Command: `--data-type schedules --start-season 1947 --end-season 1947`
- Result: HTTP 404 - "Season end year of 1947 is invalid"
- Confirms: Library does NOT support BAA years (1947-1949)

### Key Findings

1. **Library Supports**: NBA seasons 1950-2025 (75 seasons) - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
2. **Library Does NOT Support**: BAA seasons 1947-1949 (3 seasons) - returns 404
3. **Basketball Reference website HAS BAA data** but requires custom scraping
4. **Recommendation**: Start with 1950-2025 for immediate value, add BAA custom scraper later if needed

### Revised Data Volume Estimates

**NBA Years Only (1950-2025)**:
- Schedules: 75 seasons
- Player box scores: ~1.5M records (75,000 games × 20 players)
- Team box scores: ~150K records (75,000 games × 2 teams)
- Season totals: ~33,750 records (75 seasons × 450 players avg)
- Advanced totals: ~33,750 records
- Play-by-play: ~30,750 games (modern era 2000+)
- Standings: 75 seasons

### Overnight Scraper Configuration

**Updated season range in wrapper script**:
- `SEASON_START=1950` (was 1947 - changed due to BAA limitation)
- `SEASON_END=2025`
- All 7 data types configured
- Player box scores runs in background (longest job)

---

## Next Session Tasks

1. **Immediate**: Implement `scrape_basketball_reference_complete.py` with ALL endpoints
2. **After implementation**: Create `overnight_basketball_reference_comprehensive.sh`
3. **Validation**: Run all pre-deployment tests
4. **Launch**: Start overnight scraper
5. **Monitoring**: Check progress, verify S3 uploads
6. **Documentation**: Update PROGRESS.md, DATA_SOURCES.md

---

## Important Notes

- **Rate Limit**: Basketball Reference explicitly asks for 3-second delays - MUST comply
- **Data Coverage**: GET EVERYTHING - user wants maximum coverage even if unsure of need
- **Historical Value**: Early data (1946-1985) is sparse but critical for SageMaker to learn data evolution
- **Modern Data**: 2000+ has rich stats and play-by-play for validation against existing sources
- **Resume Capability**: CRITICAL - this is a long-running scraper, must handle interruptions gracefully

*Last Updated: October 7, 2025 - 10:35 PM*
*Session will continue with full implementation in next context window*
