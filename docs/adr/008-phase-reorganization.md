# ADR-008: Phase 0-3 Reorganization for Logical Data Flow

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision Maker:** Ryan Ranft + Claude Code

## Context

The current phase structure (Phase 0-6) has logical inconsistencies discovered after adding Workflow #38 (Auto-Update ESPN Data):

**Current structure:**
- **Phase 0:** Data Source Definition & Verification
  - Sub-phase 0.7: ESPN Data Gap Filling (upload existing ESPN data to S3)
- **Phase 1:** S3 Data Lake Setup
  - Sub-phase 1.3: Data Upload to S3 (upload ESPN data to S3)
- **Phase 2:** AWS Glue ETL (extract from S3)
- **Phase 3:** Database Setup (RDS)

**Problems identified:**

1. **Duplicate upload instructions:** 0.0007 and 1.0003 both describe uploading ESPN data to S3
2. **Chicken-and-egg problem:** 0.0007 instructs uploading to S3, but S3 bucket doesn't exist until 1.0002
3. **Data quality analysis out of order:** Phase 0 tries to verify data quality before data is in S3
4. **Workflow #38 placement unclear:** Auto-update workflow assumes S3 baseline exists, but runs in Phase 0 (before S3 setup)
5. **Multi-sport replication confusion:** For new sports (NFL, MLB), unclear whether to run Phase 0 or Phase 1 first

**Impact:**
- Claude Code confusion about which phase to execute
- Duplicate documentation (same steps in multiple phases)
- Difficult to replicate for new sports
- Unclear prerequisites for each phase

## Decision

Reorganize Phases 0-3 to follow a logical data flow: **Collection → Quality → Extraction → Storage**

**New phase structure:**

### **Phase 0: Data Collection & Initial Upload**
**Purpose:** Get raw data from local storage into S3 (one-time setup)

**Sub-phases:**
- 0.1: Local environment setup (conda, AWS CLI, credentials)
- 0.2: S3 bucket creation (encryption, public access blocking)
- 0.3: Initial upload of existing ESPN data (`/Users/ryanranft/0espn/data/nba/` → S3)
- 0.4: Verify upload completeness (file count, sizes, integrity)

**Moves from:** Current Phase 1 (Sub-Phases 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)

---

### **Phase 1: Data Quality & Gap Analysis**
**Purpose:** Analyze S3 data, identify gaps, establish quality baseline

**Sub-phases:**
- 1.1: Analyze S3 data coverage (date ranges, empty files, quality metrics)
- 1.2: Identify data gaps (missing dates, invalid files, coverage holes)
- 1.3: Upload local ESPN data to fill known gaps (if applicable)
- 1.4: Run Workflow #38 to scrape and fill date gaps up to today
- 1.5: Establish data quality baseline (completeness, accuracy, freshness)
- 1.6: Data source verification setup (NBA.com Stats, Basketball Reference, etc.)

**Moves from:** Current Phase 0 (Sub-Phases 0.1-0.7)

---

### **Phase 2: ETL Development (S3 → RDS)**
**Purpose:** Extract structured data from S3 JSON files into relational format

**No changes** - current Phase 2 structure remains the same

---

### **Phase 3: Database Setup & Loading**
**Purpose:** Create RDS database and load extracted data

**No changes** - current Phase 3 structure remains the same

---

## Rationale

### 1. **Logical Data Flow**
- You must have S3 before you can analyze S3 data
- You must analyze data quality before you can extract/transform it
- Each phase builds on the previous phase's output

### 2. **Eliminates Duplication**
- Single source of truth for "how to upload ESPN data to S3" (0.0003)
- Phase 1 focuses exclusively on quality/gaps, not initial upload
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Multi-Sport Replication**
For new sports (NFL, MLB, NHL):
- **Phase 0:** Upload NFL data to S3 (same process as NBA)
- **Phase 1:** Analyze NFL data quality, run NFL-specific scrapers
- **Phase 2-3:** Same ETL patterns (sport-agnostic)

### 4. **Workflow #38 Integration**
- 0.0003: Initial upload establishes S3 baseline
- 1.0004: Workflow #38 fills gaps from baseline to today
- Clear prerequisites: S3 must exist (Phase 0) before gap-filling (Phase 1)

### 5. **Claude Code Clarity**
When starting a new session:
1. Read PROGRESS.md
2. See "Phase 0: Data Collection" → immediately understand: "get data into S3"
3. See "Phase 1: Data Quality" → immediately understand: "analyze what's in S3"
4. No confusion about ordering or prerequisites

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep Current Structure, Add "Phase -1"
- **Pros:** No file renames, minimal disruption
- **Cons:** Confusing naming ("Phase -1" or "Phase 00"), doesn't solve root problem
- **Why rejected:** Adds complexity instead of reducing it

### Alternative 2: Merge Phase 0 and Phase 1 into Single Phase
- **Pros:** Fewer total phases
- **Cons:** Loses separation between collection and quality analysis, harder to replicate per sport
- **Why rejected:** Each phase should have single responsibility

### Alternative 3: Keep Phase 0 as "Foundation", Rename Phase 1 to "S3 Upload"
- **Pros:** Minimal changes to Phase 0
- **Cons:** Still has duplicate upload instructions, doesn't fix chicken-and-egg problem
- **Why rejected:** Doesn't address core logical inconsistency

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Clear logical flow: collect → analyze → extract → store
- ✅ No duplicate documentation (single source of truth per task)
- ✅ Easy multi-sport replication (same Phase 0-3 pattern for NFL, MLB, etc.)
- ✅ Workflow #38 has clear prerequisites (S3 baseline exists)
- ✅ Phase names match their actual purpose
- ✅ New Claude Code sessions start with intuitive phase order

### Negative
- ❌ All existing documentation references "Phase 0" and "Phase 1" must be updated
- ❌ PROGRESS.md must be rewritten to reflect new phase order
- ❌ Risk of broken links in documentation during transition
- ❌ Must update CLAUDE.md navigation instructions

### Mitigation
- Create comprehensive find-replace checklist before starting
- Update all phase files simultaneously (atomic change)
- Add redirects/notes at top of old phase files pointing to new structure
- Run `grep -r "Phase 0" docs/` to find all references
- Test all documentation links after reorganization

## Implementation

### Steps Required

1. **Create ADR-008** (this file) ✅
2. **Backup current phase files:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/phases/PHASE_0_DATA_SOURCES.md docs/phases/PHASE_0_DATA_SOURCES.md.backup
   cp docs/phases/PHASE_1_S3_DATA_LAKE.md docs/phases/PHASE_1_S3_DATA_LAKE.md.backup
   ```

3. **Reorganize Phase 0:**
   - Move Phase 1 content (Sub-Phases 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) → New Phase 0
   - Title: "Phase 0: Data Collection & Initial Upload"
   - Focus: Getting data into S3 (one-time setup)

4. **Reorganize Phase 1:**
   - Move 0.0007 content → New 1.0003-1.4
   - Move 0.0001-0.6 content → New 1.0001-1.2, 1.5-1.6
   - Title: "Phase 1: Data Quality & Gap Analysis"
   - Focus: Analyzing S3 data, filling gaps, establishing baseline

5. **Update PROGRESS.md:**
   - Rewrite Phase 0-1 sections with new structure
   - Update phase summaries and status
   - Update "Current Session Context" references

6. **Update CLAUDE.md:**
   - Update "Phase File Reading Protocol"
   - Update phase list in "Creating New Phase Files"
   - Update navigation examples

7. **Update workflow references:**
   - Search all workflow files for "Phase 0" and "Phase 1" references
   - Update to match new phase structure

8. **Test documentation:**
   - Verify all links work
   - Read through new Phase 0 and Phase 1 files end-to-end
   - Confirm logical flow makes sense

### Timeline
- **Estimated time:** 2-3 hours
- **Completion target:** Today (2025-10-04)

### Resources Needed
- File backups before changes
- Comprehensive grep search for all phase references
- Testing checklist for documentation links

### Dependencies
- No technical dependencies (documentation-only change)
- User approval required before starting

## Success Metrics

How will we know if this decision was successful?

1. **New Claude Code session can navigate phases without confusion:**
   - Read PROGRESS.md → understand current state
   - Read Phase 0 → know it's about initial data upload
   - Read Phase 1 → know it's about quality/gap analysis
   - No duplicate instructions encountered

2. **Multi-sport replication is straightforward:**
   - Adding NFL: Clear that Phase 0 = upload NFL data, Phase 1 = analyze/fill gaps
   - No questions about "which phase uploads data to S3?"

3. **Workflow #38 integration is clear:**
   - Prerequisites obvious (S3 must exist)
   - Placement in 1.0004 makes sense

4. **No broken documentation links:**
   - All internal links work
   - All workflow references correct
   - PROGRESS.md accurately reflects phase structure

## Review Date

**Review trigger:** When adding second sport (NFL, MLB, NHL)

At that point, verify:
- Does Phase 0-1 reorganization make multi-sport setup easier?
- Are there any remaining ambiguities?
- Should we further refine phase boundaries?

## Notes

**Key insight:** Phase numbering should reflect data flow, not implementation order.

**Previous attempts to solve this:**
- October 2-3: Added 0.0007 (ESPN Data Gap Filling) to existing Phase 0
- October 4: Created Workflow #38 (Auto-Update ESPN Data)
- Realized: 0.0007 uploads to S3, but S3 doesn't exist until Phase 1

**This reorganization finalizes the logical structure and prevents future confusion.**
