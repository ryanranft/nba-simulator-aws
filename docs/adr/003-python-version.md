# ADR-003: Python 3.11 for Development Environment

**Date:** September 29, 2025
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision Maker:** Technical constraint (AWS Glue compatibility)

## Context

Need to select Python version for:
- Local development and testing
- AWS Glue ETL jobs
- Data processing scripts
- ML model development

**Available options:** Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

**Constraints:**
- Must match AWS Glue runtime for local/cloud parity
- Must support all required data science libraries
- Must be stable and production-ready
- Should have good performance characteristics

## Decision

**Use Python 3.11.13 for all project components.**

Set up using Conda:
```bash
conda create -n nba-aws python=3.11.13
conda activate nba-aws
```

## Rationale

### 1. AWS Glue Compatibility (Primary Driver)

**AWS Glue 4.0 (latest version):**
- Supports: Python 3.10 and 3.11 only
- Does NOT support: Python 3.12+ (as of September 2025)

**Why this matters:**
- ETL scripts developed locally must run identically on AWS Glue
- Version mismatches cause subtle bugs (different library behaviors)
- Python 3.11 is the latest version supported by Glue
- Ensures "develop locally, deploy to cloud" workflow works seamlessly

### 2. Library Compatibility

**All required packages available:**
- `boto3` - AWS SDK
- `pandas 2.0.3` - Data manipulation
- `numpy 1.24.3` - Numerical computing
- `psycopg2` - PostgreSQL driver
- `sqlalchemy` - Database ORM

**Python 3.12+ issues:**
- Introduced breaking changes (removed `distutils`, changed `setuptools`)
- Some data science packages not yet fully compatible
- Would require additional compatibility shims

**Python 3.11 advantages:**
- Mature ecosystem (released October 2022)
- All packages stable and battle-tested
- No compatibility workarounds needed

### 3. Performance

**Python 3.11 performance improvements:**
- 10-60% faster than Python 3.9/3.10
- Faster function calls
- Improved dictionary operations
- Better list comprehensions

**Benefits for this project:**
- ETL processing of 146,115 files
- Repeated data transformations
- JSON parsing and manipulation
- Database queries and data loading

**Real-world impact:**
- ETL job that takes 3 hours on Python 3.9 → ~2 hours on Python 3.11
- Faster local development and testing

### 4. Future-Proofing

**Support timeline:**
- Python 3.11 released: October 2022
- Bug fixes until: October 2024
- Security fixes until: October 2027

**AWS Glue support:**
- AWS typically adds Python version 6-12 months after release
- Python 3.11 will be supported for years to come
- Easy upgrade path to 3.12+ when Glue adds support

**Upgrade strategy when 3.12+ available:**
1. Test locally with Python 3.12
2. Wait for AWS Glue to add support
3. Update conda environment
4. Test ETL jobs
5. Deploy (minimal code changes expected)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Python 3.10
- **Pros:** Also Glue-compatible, slightly more conservative choice
- **Cons:**
  - Slower than 3.11 (10-25% performance penalty)
  - Missing 3.11 features and improvements
  - Will need to upgrade eventually anyway
- **Why rejected:** 3.11 offers better performance with no compatibility downsides

### Alternative 2: Python 3.12+
- **Pros:** Latest features, even better performance, modern improvements
- **Cons:**
  - **NOT compatible with AWS Glue 4.0** (deal-breaker)
  - Would require version switching between local and AWS
  - Some library compatibility issues
  - Risk of local/cloud behavior differences
- **Why rejected:** Glue incompatibility makes this non-viable

### Alternative 3: Python 3.9
- **Pros:** Very stable, maximum compatibility, conservative choice
- **Cons:**
  - Slower performance
  - Missing 3.10 and 3.11 improvements
  - AWS Glue 3.0 (older), not latest Glue version
- **Why rejected:** No advantage over 3.11, worse performance

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Maximum compatibility with AWS Glue 4.0
- ✅ Stable, mature package ecosystem
- ✅ 10-60% performance improvement over Python 3.9
- ✅ Matches cloud environment exactly (no surprises)
- ✅ Future-proof for at least 2-3 years
- ✅ Active community support

### Negative
- ❌ Cannot use Python 3.12+ features (pattern matching improvements, etc.)
- ❌ Will eventually need to upgrade when Glue adds 3.12+ support

### Neutral
- Python 3.11 features are more than sufficient for this project
- No critical Python 3.12+ features needed for data processing
- Easy to upgrade later with minimal code changes

## Implementation

### Environment Setup (✅ Complete)
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n nba-aws python=3.11.13

# Activate environment
conda activate nba-aws

# Install packages
pip install boto3 pandas numpy psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version
# Output: Python 3.11.13

# Check Glue compatibility
python -c "import sys; print('Compatible with Glue 4.0' if sys.version_info[:2] in [(3,10),(3,11)] else 'NOT compatible')"
# Output: Compatible with Glue 4.0
```

### Documentation
- ✅ Added to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Added to PROGRESS.md
- ✅ Added to README.md
- ⏸️ Add to SETUP.md (pending)

## Success Metrics

This decision is successful if:
- ✅ All ETL scripts run identically locally and on AWS Glue
- ✅ No Python version-related bugs or compatibility issues
- ✅ Performance improvements measurable in ETL processing time
- ✅ All required libraries install and work correctly
- ✅ No need to downgrade or change Python version within 12 months

## Review Date

**Review when:** AWS Glue announces Python 3.12+ support (estimated 2026)

**Review criteria:**
- Is Python 3.12+ available in Glue?
- Do all our libraries support 3.12+?
- Are there performance or feature benefits?
- Is the upgrade effort justified?

**Upgrade decision factors:**
- Breaking changes in 3.12+
- Performance improvements
- New features that would benefit the project
- Library compatibility status

## Notes

### AWS Glue Version History
- **Glue 3.0:** Python 3.9 (Spark 3.1)
- **Glue 4.0:** Python 3.10, 3.11 (Spark 3.3) ← **Current choice**
- **Glue 5.0:** Expected to add Python 3.12+ (2026?)

### Performance Benchmarks (Python 3.11 vs 3.9)
- JSON parsing: ~25% faster
- Pandas operations: ~15-20% faster
- List operations: ~30% faster
- Function calls: ~10% faster
- Overall ETL: ~20-30% faster (estimated)

### Local Development Parity
Using exact same Python version as AWS Glue ensures:
- Identical behavior between local and cloud
- No surprises when deploying to Glue
- Can test ETL jobs locally with confidence
- Reduces debugging time in cloud environment

### Conda vs venv
**Why Conda?**
- Better dependency resolution for data science packages
- Easier to manage binary dependencies (like `psycopg2`)
- Can install different Python versions easily
- Standard in data science community
