# ADR-004: Git Without GitHub Push

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Status:** Superseded by [ADR-005](005-git-ssh-authentication.md)
**Decision Maker:** Project Team

## Context

Initial project setup needed version control but encountered authentication issues when attempting to push to GitHub. The immediate need was to:
- Track code changes locally with Git
- Maintain version history
- Enable future GitHub integration

However, GitHub push authentication was not immediately working, and the project needed to proceed with development.

## Decision

Use Git for local version control without pushing to GitHub remote repository. Continue development with local commits only, deferring GitHub integration until authentication issues could be resolved.

## Rationale

1. **Unblock Development:**
   - Git authentication issues should not halt project progress
   - Local version control still provides value

2. **Temporary Solution:**
   - Defer GitHub push until proper authentication configured
   - All commits preserved locally for future push

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Local commits better than no version control
   - Can bulk push commits once GitHub access resolved

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Fix GitHub Authentication Immediately
- **Pros:** Complete solution, immediate GitHub backup
- **Cons:** Time-consuming, blocks development progress
- **Why deferred:** Development momentum more important than immediate remote backup

### Alternative 2: Use Different Git Host
- **Pros:** Might have easier authentication
- **Cons:** GitHub already chosen as standard platform
- **Why rejected:** Temporary workaround not worth switching platforms

### Alternative 3: No Version Control
- **Pros:** No authentication issues to solve
- **Cons:** Loss of all version control benefits
- **Why rejected:** Unacceptable risk for any software project

## Consequences

### Positive
- Development can proceed immediately
- Local version history preserved
- All commits available for future push

### Negative
- No remote backup of code changes
- Single point of failure (local machine)
- Cannot collaborate via GitHub yet

### Mitigation
- Regular local backups
- Resolve GitHub authentication ASAP
- Document all commits for future push

## Implementation

**Completed:**
- Git initialized locally
- `.gitignore` configured
- Local commits being made regularly

**Deferred:**
- GitHub remote configuration
- SSH key setup
- Push authentication

## Success Metrics

This was a temporary decision, superseded when authentication was resolved:
- ✅ Local commits maintained development history
- ✅ No lost work during authentication resolution period
- ✅ All commits successfully pushed once authentication fixed

## Review Date

**Resolution Date:** September 30, 2025
- Issue resolved by implementing SSH authentication
- See [ADR-005](005-git-ssh-authentication.md) for permanent solution

## Notes

This ADR documents a temporary workaround that was necessary during initial project setup. The decision was superseded within the same day by ADR-005, which implemented proper SSH authentication for GitHub.

**Historical Context:**
- This represents good decision-making: prioritizing development progress while planning to properly resolve authentication
- Demonstrates that temporary decisions should be documented even if quickly superseded
- All local commits were successfully pushed once ADR-005 was implemented
