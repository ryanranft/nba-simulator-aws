   - Existing tables unchanged
   - New temporal tables added in Sub-Phase 3.5
   - Existing queries work unchanged
   - New queries use stored procedures

2. **Simulation (Phase 4):**
   - Existing simulation unchanged
   - New temporal simulation in Sub-Phase 4.5
   - Optional enhancement (can use traditional or temporal)

3. **ML (Phase 5):**
   - Existing features unchanged
   - New temporal features in Sub-Phase 5.5
   - 50+ new features available for models
   - Expected 5-20% accuracy improvement

4. **Cost:**
   - Base system: $38.33/month (unchanged)
   - With temporal: $57-75/month (+$19-37)
   - Still well under $150/month budget

## What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Validate documentation consistency** ✅ (this document)
2. **Commit temporal enhancement** (pending user approval)
3. **Update session context in PROGRESS.md**
4. **Decide on implementation timeline:**
   - Option A: Start implementation immediately (8 weeks)
   - Option B: Defer temporal until multi-source integration complete
   - Option C: Implement in parallel (multi-source + temporal)

### Implementation Prerequisites

**Before starting temporal implementation:**

1. [ ] Review all 7 new documents
2. [ ] Approve cost increase (+$19-37/month)
3. [ ] Approve 8-week timeline (160-200 hours)
4. [ ] Allocate 250-350 GB RDS storage
5. [ ] Review and approve ADR-009 architecture decisions

**Then follow:** `docs/TEMPORAL_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`

---

## User Decision Points

### Decision 1: Approve Temporal Enhancement?

**If YES:**
- Proceed with implementation using roadmap
- Budget for +$19-37/month ongoing cost
- Allocate 8 weeks for full implementation
- Expected delivery: Core in Week 4, Full in Week 8

**If NO:**
- Keep traditional game-level system
- No cost increase
- All temporal docs available for future reference

---

### Decision 2: Implementation Timing?

**Option A: Immediate (Recommended)**
- Start Week 1 immediately
- Deliverable in 4 weeks (core) or 8 weeks (full)
- Parallel to any other work

**Option B: After Multi-Source Integration**
- Complete Phase 1 multi-source integration first
- Then start temporal (will have more data)
- Estimated start: 4 weeks from now

**Option C: Parallel**
- Run multi-source integration AND temporal implementation
- Higher complexity, faster overall delivery
- Requires careful coordination

---

### Decision 3: Scope?

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**
- Week 1-4 only (core temporal capability)
- 4 tables, BRIN indexes, stored procedures
- Player snapshots, age calculations
- Cost: +$19-37/month
- Time: 4 weeks

**Full Enhancement:**
- Week 1-8 (core + advanced features)
- Everything in MVP plus:
- Temporal simulation features
- Temporal ML features (50+ features)
- Advanced query patterns
- Production-ready deployment
- Cost: +$19-37/month (same as MVP)
- Time: 8 weeks

**Recommended:** Full Enhancement (only 4 extra weeks for major capability boost)

**No code written yet** - This enhancement phase focused on comprehensive planning and documentation. Implementation can proceed using the roadmap when approved.

**Budget-friendly** - Cost increase of $19-37/month keeps total system cost at $57-95/month, well under the $150/month target.

**Backward compatible** - All existing queries and workflows continue to work unchanged. Temporal queries are additive.

**Production-ready design** - 25 validation tests, monitoring procedures, failure recovery plans, and performance benchmarks ensure production quality.
