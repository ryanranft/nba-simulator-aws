## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

#### Risk 1: Query Performance Degradation

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (slow queries unusable)

**Mitigation:**
1. Pre-compute snapshots at optimal frequency
2. Use BRIN indexes (70% storage savings)
3. Partition by year if > 500M events
4. Monitor query times weekly

**Contingency:** Add read replicas if needed (+$17-29/month)

---

#### Risk 2: Snapshot Generation Time

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (delays data availability)

**Mitigation:**
1. Parallelize snapshot generation by season
2. Use EC2 larger instance for batch jobs
3. Generate incrementally (only new games)

**Contingency:** Use Lambda for distributed processing

---

#### Risk 3: Birth Date Unavailability

**Likelihood:** High (historical players)
**Impact:** Low (age calculations return NULL)

**Mitigation:**
1. Document data completeness by era
2. Store birth date precision flag
3. Return NULL for missing data
4. Gradually improve coverage

**Contingency:** Estimate birth dates from draft year (Â±6 months accuracy)

---

#### Risk 4: Timestamp Precision Inconsistency

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (query accuracy issues)

**Mitigation:**
1. Store `precision_level` with each event
2. Store `data_source` for traceability
3. Allow filtering by precision
4. Document limitations

**Contingency:** Provide confidence intervals for imprecise data

---

### Low-Priority Risks

- **Cost overruns:** Monitor storage growth weekly, archive old data to Glacier
- **Data quality issues:** Set up automated validation tests (daily)
- **Integration complexity:** Start with core features, add enhancements later
