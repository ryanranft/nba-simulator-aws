## üéì Phase 2: Feature Engineering Data (Weeks 3-4)

### **Goal:** Add 40+ engineered features for ML model

#### **2.1: Recent Performance Data**

**What's Needed:**
- Last 5 games per team (rolling window)
- Last 10 games for trend calculation
- Win/loss streaks

**Collection Strategy:**
```sql
-- Create materialized view for efficient recent game lookups
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW team_recent_games AS
SELECT
    team_id,
    game_date,
    season,
    points_scored,
    points_allowed,
    won,
    LAG(points_scored, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY team_id ORDER BY game_date) as prev_game_score,
    -- Rolling 5-game averages
    AVG(points_scored) OVER (
        PARTITION BY team_id ORDER BY game_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as last5_ppg
FROM (
    SELECT
        home_team_id as team_id,
        game_date,
        season,
        home_score as points_scored,
        away_score as points_allowed,
        CASE WHEN home_score > away_score THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as won
    FROM games
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        away_team_id as team_id,
        game_date,
        season,
        away_score as points_scored,
        home_score as points_allowed,
        CASE WHEN away_score > home_score THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as won
    FROM games
) team_games;
```

#### **2.2: Rest/Fatigue Data**

**What's Needed:**
- Days rest between games per team
- Back-to-back game indicators
- Travel distance (optional, nice-to-have)

**Collection Strategy:**
```bash
# Calculate rest days
python scripts/ml/calculate_rest_days.py \
    --start-season 2015 \
    --end-season 2025 \
    --output-table team_rest_schedule

# Expected output: team_id, game_id, days_rest, is_b2b
```

#### **2.3: Lineup Data (Optional Phase 2, Required Phase 3)**

**What's Needed:**
- 5-player lineup combinations
- Lineup stats (ORTG, DRTG, possessions played)
- Average height, experience

**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **SPARSE DATA** - Not available before 2016

**Collection Strategy:**
```bash
# Source 1: NBA.com Advanced Stats API (2015-present)
python scripts/scrapers/nba_api_lineup_scraper.py \
    --start-season 2016 \
    --end-season 2025 \
    --min-possessions 50

# Source 2: Basketball Reference (backup)
python scripts/scrapers/basketball_reference_lineup_scraper.py \
    --start-season 2016 \
    --end-season 2025
```

**Fallback Strategy (if lineup data unavailable):**
- Use team-level stats as proxy
- Add player biographical features (height, experience)
- Start with team-only model, add lineups later

---

   - Source: Basketball Reference scraping

2. **1960-1980 (Medium Priority)** - Transitional era, fewer stats
   - Target: Basic box scores (PTS, REB, AST minimum)
   - Missing: Often no steals/blocks/turnovers until 1973+
   - Source: Basketball Reference + Retrosheet

3. **1946-1960 (Low Priority)** - Minimal data
   - Target: Game-level aggregates only
   - Team totals: Points, FGM/FGA, FTM/FTA

python scripts/data_assessment/validate_historical_data.py \
    --start-season 1980 \
    --end-season 1999 \
    --expected-games-per-season 1230
```

#### **3.2: Play-by-Play Historical Expansion**

**Currently Running:**
- ‚úÖ hoopR Phase 1B: 2016 ‚Üí 1997 (19 seasons remaining, ~48 hours estimated)

**Next Phase:**
```bash
# hoopR Phase 1C: Extend further back if available
python scripts/scrapers/hoopr_phase1c_scraper.py \
    --start-season 1997 \
    --end-season 1990 \
    --check-availability

# Expected: Play-by-play may not exist before ~1996-97

   - Use: Lineup interaction features

**Collection Priority:** Phase 5+ (after core simulator working)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 4: Data Pipeline Infrastructure (Week 6)

### **Goal:** Automate data updates and quality monitoring

#### **4.1: Daily Update Pipeline**

```bash
# Integrated data pipeline (already created - Workflow #48)
bash scripts/monitoring/data_pipeline_manager.sh full

# Modes:
# - status: Inventory current data
# - plan: Identify gaps
# - collect: Launch scrapers
# - validate: Run quality checks
# - full: Complete pipeline
```

#### **4.2: Data Quality Monitoring**

**Automated Checks:**

1. **Completeness Check** (daily)
   - Expected games vs actual games per season
   - Missing possession data
   - Alert if <95% complete

2. **Quality Check** (weekly)
   - Reasonable score ranges (era-adjusted)
   - No impossible values (FGM > FGA, etc.)
   - Internal consistency (PBP ‚Üí box score reconstruction)
   - Alert if quality score <80%

3. **Freshness Check** (daily)
   - Latest game in database vs actual schedule
   - Gap > 2 days = alert

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Create monitoring cron job
# Add to crontab: 0 2 * * * (daily at 2am)
bash scripts/monitoring/daily_data_quality_check.sh \
    --email-alerts \
    --slack-webhook $SLACK_URL \
    --output reports/daily_quality_$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

## üîç Critical Gaps Analysis

### **Blocking Issues (Must Resolve First):**

1. **Possessions Table Missing?**
   - Check: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM possessions WHERE season BETWEEN 2015 AND 2025`
   - If 0 rows: Run `create_possession_panel_from_espn.py`
   - Expected: 2-3M possessions for 2015-2025

2. **Team Season Stats Missing?**
   - Check: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_season_stats WHERE season BETWEEN 2015 AND 2025`
   - If 0 rows: Calculate from play-by-play/box scores
   - Expected: ~330 team-seasons (30 teams √ó 11 seasons)

3. **Venues Table Missing?**
   - Check: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM venues WHERE elevation_ft IS NOT NULL`
   - Critical for altitude adjustment (Denver effect)
   - Minimum: 30 current arenas + historical arenas

### **Non-Blocking Gaps (Nice-to-Have):**

4. **Box Score Players (2021-2025)** - 3 recent seasons missing
