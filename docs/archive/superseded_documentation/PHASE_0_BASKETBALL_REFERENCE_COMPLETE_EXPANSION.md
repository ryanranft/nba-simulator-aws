3. **Extend existing scrapers:**
   ```python
   # Tier 5B: Extend shooting scraper
   def scrape_shooting(self, season):
       # Current: Captures basic shooting columns
       # Enhanced: Capture ALL columns including dunks, corner 3s, heaves
       all_columns = ['Dunks', 'Corner3', 'Heaves', 'AssistedPct']
   ```

**Rate Limiting:**
- Maintain 12s between requests for Basketball-Reference.com
- Adjust for Sports-Reference.com/cbb/ (same domain, same rate limit)
- No rate limiting needed for single-page scrapes
