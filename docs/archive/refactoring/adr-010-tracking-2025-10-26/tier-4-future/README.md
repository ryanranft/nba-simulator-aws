## Overview

Tier 4 contains optional enhancements that improve developer experience but are not critical. These can be implemented later or skipped entirely.

---

## Tasks in Tier 4

| # | Task | Creates | Time | Status |
|---|------|---------|------|--------|
| 4.1 | [Create Auto-Generators](10-auto-generators.md) | Scripts to generate phases/sub-phases | 25 min | ⏸️ PENDING |
| 4.2 | [Review Session Manager](16-session-manager-review.md) | Verify no hardcoded patterns | 5 min | ⏸️ PENDING |

**Total: ~30 minutes**

---

## Why Optional

- **Auto-generators:** Nice to have, but manual creation works fine
- **Session manager:** Likely already dynamic, just needs verification

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Auto-generator scripts created (if desired)
✅ Session manager reviewed and confirmed dynamic
