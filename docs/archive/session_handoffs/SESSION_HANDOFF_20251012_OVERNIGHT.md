   ```bash
   # Verify scraper completed
   ps -p 88290

   # Check final log output
   tail -100 /tmp/bbref_comprehensive_overnight.log

   # Count uploaded files
   for type in draft awards per_game shooting play_by_play team_ratings playoffs coaches standings; do
     count=$(aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/basketball_reference/$type/ --recursive | wc -l)
     echo "$type: $count files"
   done
   ```

2. **Validate Data Quality**
   ```bash
   # Check error rate
   grep -c "ERROR" /tmp/bbref_comprehensive_overnight.log

   # Verify no HTTP 403 blocks
   grep "403" /tmp/bbref_comprehensive_overnight.log

   # Spot check 5 random files

     --limit 10 \
     --verbose

   # If successful, deploy full batch
   nohup python3 scripts/pbp_to_boxscore/batch_process_espn.py \
     --start-season 1993 \
     --end-season 2025 \
     --output /tmp/phase9_snapshots/ \

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Basketball Reference Scraper

**Early Season Data Gaps:**
- Seasons 1946-1949: Most data types don't exist (0/8 collected)
- This is expected - Basketball Reference data starts later for many types
- Shooting stats: Start 2000
- Play-by-play stats: Start 2001
- Team ratings: Start 1974

**No Issues:**
- âœ… No HTTP 403 blocks with 12s rate limit
- âœ… No 429 rate limit errors
- âœ… S3 uploads working correctly
- âœ… No connection timeouts

### Phase 9 ESPN Processor

**Limitations:**
- Currently tracks scores only (no player-level stats)
- ESPN PBP JSON lacks structured participant data
- Would need text parsing to extract player actions
- **This is expected** - focuses on game state tracking

**Future Enhancements:**
- Add text parsing for player-level stats
- Integrate with hoopR box scores for validation
- Add advanced metrics layer (TS%, PER, etc.)
