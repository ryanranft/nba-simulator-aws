# Session Handoff - October 7, 2025 (Lineup Integration Work)

**Session Time:** 9:25 PM - 9:50 PM PT  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Team ID Format Mismatch Discovered  
**Context:** Continuing from morning's player ID breakthrough

---

## üéØ Session Goal

Enhance Kaggle possession panel script to integrate hoopR starting lineups for complete 10-player tracking (5 offense + 5 defense).

---

## ‚úÖ Completed This Session

### 1. Overnight Scraper Status (Workflow #38)
- **NBA API Play-by-Play**: 696/1,189 games (58.5%), running with expected timeouts
- **NBA API Comprehensive**: Stuck on 1997 season with rate limiting
- **Action**: Let continue running, expected behavior

### 2. Created Enhanced Possession Panel Script
- **File**: `scripts/etl/create_possession_panel_with_hoopr_lineups.py` (542 lines)
- **LineupTracker class**: Manages 10-player lineups (5 offense + 5 defense)
- **Game matching**: By date + teams (handles different game_id formats)
- **Status**: Code complete but blocked by team ID mismatch

---

## üö® Critical Discovery: Team ID Format Mismatch

### The Problem

**Different team ID systems block game matching:**

| Data Source | Team ID Format | Example (2022-06-16) |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Kaggle/games | NBA API (long) | `1610612738`, `1610612744` |
| hoopR | ESPN (short) | `2`, `9` |

**Impact**: Cannot join hoopR starters with Kaggle events ‚Üí No lineup integration possible

### Evidence
```sql
-- hoopR teams on 2022-06-16 (Finals Game 6)
SELECT DISTINCT team_id FROM hoopr_player_box WHERE game_date = '2022-06-16';
-- Result: 2, 9 (Boston, Golden State in ESPN format)

-- Kaggle teams on same date
SELECT home_team_id, away_team_id FROM games WHERE game_date = '2022-06-16';  
-- Result: 1610612738, 1610612744 (NBA API format)
```

### Date Coverage (Good News)
- **hoopR**: 2001-10-30 to 2025-06-22
- **Kaggle**: 1996-11-01 to 2023-06-09
- **Overlap**: 2001-2023 (22 seasons, ~20K games)

## üìä Data Compatibility Summary

| Aspect | Kaggle/NBA API | hoopR/ESPN | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **Player IDs** | N/A | ESPN (e.g., `1966`) | ‚úÖ Compatible (morning breakthrough) |
| **Game IDs** | `29600012` | `220612017` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Different, solved via date match |
| **Team IDs** | `1610612738` | `2` | ‚ùå **BLOCKER** - Need mapping |

---

## üîß Solutions to Unblock

### Option 1: hoopR Phase 2 Team Endpoint (Recommended)
- Endpoint: `nba_teams` from hoopR Phase 2
- May provide ESPN ID ‚Üî NBA API ID mapping
- **Next step**: Check hoopR Phase 2 documentation

### Option 2: Manual 30-Team Mapping
- Create static mapping table (30 teams)
- Map by team abbreviation (BOS, GSW, etc.)
- Pro: Simple, static data
- Con: Manual maintenance

### Option 3: Team Abbreviation Join
- Both sources likely have team abbreviations
- Join games by: `date + home_abbr + away_abbr`
- Risk: Abbreviation inconsistencies

---

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Scripts (This Session)
1. **`scripts/etl/create_possession_panel_with_hoopr_lineups.py`** (542 lines)
   - LineupTracker class (init, update, get_current)
   - Game matching query (date + teams with mapping)
   - Lineup column integration (10 player IDs)
   - **Status**: Blocked by team_id mapping

### Pending Changes
- Script is complete but NOT tested (0 games matched)
- NOT committed to git (waiting for team ID resolution)

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Investigate hoopR Phase 2 for team mapping**
   ```bash
   # Check if hoopR has nba_teams endpoint
   ls -la /tmp/hoopr_data/nba_teams_*.csv 2>/dev/null
   # Or check Phase 2 documentation
   cat docs/HOOPR_152_ENDPOINTS_GUIDE.md | grep -i "team"
   ```

2. **Create team_id_mapping table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE team_id_mapping (
       espn_team_id VARCHAR(10),    -- e.g., "2"
       nba_api_team_id VARCHAR(20), -- e.g., "1610612738"
       team_abbr VARCHAR(3),         -- e.g., "BOS"
       team_name VARCHAR(100),
       PRIMARY KEY (espn_team_id, nba_api_team_id)
   );
   ```

3. **Update lineup integration query**
   - Add team_id_mapping joins
   - Test on 3-5 games
   - Verify lineup coverage

### Short-Term (This Week)
4. **Scale to full dataset**
   - Process all ~20K overlapping games
   - Generate possession panels with lineups
   - Load to PostgreSQL

5. **Begin simulation framework** (user's request)
   - Train models on panel data
   - Implement Monte Carlo simulation
   - Test predictions

## üí° Key Learnings

### From Morning Session
- ‚úÖ hoopR uses ESPN player IDs (LeBron = `1966`)
- ‚úÖ No player mapping needed (4-6 week savings)

### From Evening Session  
- ‚ùå hoopR uses ESPN team IDs (short format)
- ‚ùå Kaggle uses NBA API team IDs (long format)
- ‚è≥ Need team mapping to proceed

### Architecture Insight
**Why we need both player & team mappings:**
- Player IDs: Already compatible (ESPN format)
- Team IDs: Incompatible (ESPN vs NBA API)
- Game IDs: Different but solvable (date matching)

## üìû Handoff Questions

1. **Does hoopR Phase 2 provide team ID mapping?**
   - Check `nba_teams` endpoint
   - Look for ESPN ID ‚Üî NBA API ID columns

2. **Best approach for team mapping?**
   - Scrape from hoopR Phase 2?
   - Manual 30-team mapping?
   - Team abbreviation join?

3. **After mapping complete:**
   - Test on 3-5 games first?
   - Or proceed to full dataset (~20K games)?
