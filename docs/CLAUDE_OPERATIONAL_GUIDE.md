## Session Initialization

### Always Run at Start of Each Session

**Automatically run (don't ask user, just do it):**

```bash
source scripts/shell/session_manager.sh start
```

**What it checks:**
- Hardware: Model, Chip, Cores, Memory
- System: macOS version, Homebrew version and location
- Conda: Version, base path, active environment
- Python: Version, location, key packages (boto3, pandas, numpy)
- AWS CLI: Version and location
- Git: Version, location, status (branch, modified/untracked files), recent commits
- **Documentation status:** FILE_INVENTORY.md age, session history, command log, PROGRESS.md tasks, stale docs
- **Conversation logging:** Offers terminal session logging setup
- **Command logging:** Auto-sources log_command.sh functions

**Output format:** Clean, organized sections with all diagnostic details preserved

**Show output to user** for review at session start

**After EVERY commit:** Append to `.session-history.md`:
```bash
bash scripts/shell/session_manager.sh start >> .session-history.md
```
This creates version snapshot for each commit, correlating git history with exact software versions used

**Check conversation status:**
- If CHAT_LOG.md exists and stale (>30 min): Remind user it will be overwritten at 75% context
- If context approaching 75%: Proactively mention auto-save is coming soon
- CHAT_LOG.md is auto-managed - no user action needed

**Initial orientation:**
- Identify current phase from PROGRESS.md
- Review documentation status warnings from `session_manager.sh start` output
- Ask: "Any work completed since last session that should be marked ‚úÖ COMPLETE in PROGRESS.md?"

### Proactive Maintenance Suggestions

**Ask user if they want to run (based on time since last update):**

- **Monday or 7+ days since last update:** "Would you like me to run `make update-docs` for weekly maintenance?"
- **7+ days since last inventory:** "Should I run `make inventory` to update file summaries?"
- **New AWS resources may exist:** "Should I run `make sync-progress` to check if PROGRESS.md matches AWS?"
- **After modifying .md files:** "After these changes, should I run `make inventory` to update FILE_INVENTORY.md?"

### Session End Reminder

**At end of session, remind user:**

- If COMMAND_LOG.md modified: "Remember to review COMMAND_LOG.md for sensitive data before committing"
- If multiple files changed: "Consider running `make backup` to create a backup"
- If documentation changed: "Consider running `make inventory` to update file summaries"
- If phase completed: "Phase complete! Update PROGRESS.md status to ‚úÖ COMPLETE and run `make sync-progress`"

---

## Progress Tracking Protocol

### CRITICAL - Always Follow These Rules

#### 1. Always Read PROGRESS.md First

Understand what has been completed and what's next before starting any work.

#### 2. Follow PROGRESS.md Sequentially

Start from the first "‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING" or "üîÑ IN PROGRESS" task. Do not skip ahead unless explicitly instructed.

#### 3. If the Plan Changes

Update PROGRESS.md BEFORE proceeding with new work:
- Document what changed and why
- Update task descriptions, time estimates, or dependencies
- Add new tasks or remove obsolete ones
- Mark changed sections with date and reason
- **Get user confirmation before proceeding with the updated plan**

#### 4. Only Mark Tasks as "‚úÖ COMPLETE" When You Receive

Either:
- Terminal output showing successful execution (exit code 0, expected output) **AND** user says "done", "complete", "looks good", or similar affirmation
- **OR:** User proceeds to ask about the next task (implicit confirmation)
- **Exception:** Minor tasks (<5 min) can be auto-marked if command succeeds with clear success output

#### 5. Do NOT Assume Completion

Even if a command runs without errors, wait for user confirmation.

#### 6. Update PROGRESS.md Immediately

After each completed step.

#### 7. If Errors Occur

Document them in PROGRESS.md and work with user to resolve before proceeding.

#### 8. Maintain the Same Format and Detail Level

When updating PROGRESS.md.

### Update PROGRESS.md When

- ‚úÖ Completing any phase or sub-phase
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Discovering blockers or missing prerequisites
- üìù Changing approach or architecture
- ‚ùå Encountering errors that delay timeline
- ‚úÖ User explicitly confirms task completion
- üí∞ Actual costs differ significantly from estimates

### Proactively Suggest Running Maintenance Tasks When

- **After completing a phase:** "Phase X.Y complete! Should I run `make sync-progress` to verify AWS resources match PROGRESS.md?"
- **After creating/modifying scripts:** "New scripts created. Should I run `make inventory` to update FILE_INVENTORY.md?"
- **After solving a new error:** "This error isn't in TROUBLESHOOTING.md yet. Should I add it? (Then run `make inventory`)"
- **After making architectural decisions:** "Should I create an ADR for this decision? (See docs/adr/template.md)"
- **After creating AWS resources:** "New AWS resources created. Should I run `make check-costs` to see the cost impact?"
- **Monday morning or start of week:** "It's a new week! Should I run `make update-docs` for weekly maintenance?"
- **After 5+ commits:** "Several commits made. Should I run `make backup` to create a backup?"

### Error Handling Protocol

- If a command fails, **STOP and report to user immediately**
- Do NOT attempt multiple fixes without user guidance
- Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for known solutions first (use grep, don't read fully)
- If unknown error, log with `log_solution` after resolving
- Update PROGRESS.md with error details and resolution

### Context Awareness

- Check what phase we're in before suggesting commands
- Don't suggest Phase 3 commands if Phase 2 isn't complete
- Verify prerequisites exist before executing dependent tasks
- Use `python scripts/maintenance/sync_progress.py` if unsure of current state

### Standard Workflow

1. Read PROGRESS.md to understand current state
2. **If user requests changes to the plan:** Update PROGRESS.md first, get confirmation, then proceed
3. Execute the next pending task
4. Wait for confirmation (terminal output or user saying "done")
5. Update PROGRESS.md to mark task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
6. Move to next task

## Command & Code Logging

### CRITICAL: Log ALL Code Changes and Outcomes to COMMAND_LOG.md

Command logging serves as a learning database - tracking what works, what fails, and why. This helps avoid repeating mistakes and reference successful solutions.

### When Writing/Editing Code Files

**Manually document in COMMAND_LOG.md:**
- **What you created/changed:** File path, function/class name, purpose
- **Code snippet:** The actual code written (if short) or summary (if long)
- **Outcome:** Did it work? Any errors? What was learned?

### Format

```markdown
## [Timestamp] Code Change: [Brief Description]
**File:** `path/to/file.py`
**Purpose:** What this code does and why

**Code:**
```python
# Actual code snippet or summary
```

**Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Success / ‚ùå Failed
- Error messages (if any)
- What worked / what didn't
- Lessons learned
```

### When to Log

- ‚úÖ New functions/classes created
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes (what was broken, how you fixed it)
- ‚úÖ Refactoring (what changed, why)
- ‚úÖ Failed attempts (what didn't work, why)
- ‚úÖ Performance improvements

### Why This Matters

- Learn from past mistakes (avoid repeating failed approaches)
- Track what patterns work well in this codebase
- Build institutional knowledge of trial and error
- Reference successful solutions for similar problems

### When Executing Terminal Commands

Encourage user to use the command logging system:
- Source the logging script: `source scripts/shell/log_command.sh`
- Execute commands with: `log_cmd <command>`
- Example: `log_cmd aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/`

### Reference COMMAND_LOG.md When Debugging

Learn from past solutions:
- **Before writing new code:** Check if similar code was written before
- **When errors occur:** Search for similar error messages in log
- **When choosing approaches:** Review what worked/failed previously
- Use as a learning database of what works in this project

### Add Solutions to Errors

Use `log_solution <description>` helper function after resolving unknown errors.

### CRITICAL - Before Committing COMMAND_LOG.md to Git

- Always review for sensitive information (credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Sanitize AWS account IDs if sharing publicly
- Replace sensitive IPs/endpoints with placeholders
- Remove or redact any Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- **Remind user to review before any `git add` or `git commit` that includes COMMAND_LOG.md**

## Documentation Update Triggers

### Manual Updates Required

The following documentation requires MANUAL updates (cannot be automated):

| Document | Update When | How to Update |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **PROGRESS.md** | After completing phase/task | Change ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE, update "Last Updated" |
| **PROGRESS.md** | After creating AWS resources | Run `make check-costs`, update cost estimates with actuals |
| **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** | After solving new error | Add new section with problem/solution, run `make inventory` |
| **ADRs** | After architectural decision | Create `docs/adr/00X-name.md` from template, update `docs/adr/README.md` |
| **STYLE_GUIDE.md** | When code style preference emerges | Add rule with example, explain reasoning |
| **QUICKSTART.md** | When daily workflow changes | Update relevant command section |
| **TESTING.md** | When testing strategy evolves | Update approach, add examples |
| **.env.example** | When new env variables needed | Add variable with description |
| **COMMAND_LOG.md** | After every significant command OR code change | Use `log_cmd`, `log_note`, `log_solution` for commands; manually log all code snippets with outcomes |

### When to Add to TROUBLESHOOTING.md

‚úÖ **Add when:**
- Errors that took >10 minutes to solve
- Non-obvious solutions (wouldn't find with quick Google search)
- Environment-specific issues (conda, AWS, macOS-specific)
- Recurring errors (seen multiple times in session)
- Errors with misleading messages (actual cause different from error text)

‚ùå **Don't add when:**
- Typos or syntax errors (obvious from error message)
- One-time issues (unlikely to recur)
- Already documented in official docs

### When to Create ADRs

‚úÖ **Create when:**
- Significant architectural decisions (database choice, service selection, framework adoption)
- Technology choices with long-term impact (Python version, AWS service vs self-hosted)
- Major trade-offs (cost vs performance, simplicity vs scalability, storage vs compute)
- Decisions affecting multiple parts of system (authentication method, logging strategy, error handling)
- Rejecting common approaches (why NOT using X, why avoiding Y)
- Development workflow changes (build process, deployment strategy, testing approach)

‚ùå **Don't create when:**
- Small implementation details (variable naming, file organization)
- Temporary workarounds (quick fixes, patches)
- Obvious choices with no alternatives (using JSON for config, Git for version control)
- Easily reversible decisions with no consequences (UI colors, log message format)

### When to Update QUICKSTART.md

‚úÖ **Update when:**
- New daily commands added (scripts, make targets, common operations)
- File locations changed (moved scripts, reorganized directories)
- Workflow shortcuts discovered (aliases, one-liners that save time)
- Common troubleshooting steps identified (frequently used fixes)

‚ùå **Don't update when:**
- Rarely-used commands (less than weekly usage)
- One-time setup steps (belongs in docs/SETUP.md instead)
- Experimental commands (not proven yet)

### When to Update STYLE_GUIDE.md

‚úÖ **Update when:**
- Consistent pattern used 3+ times (establishes precedent)
- Readability improvements (type hints, docstring formats)
- Team conventions (naming patterns, file structure)
- Language-specific best practices (Python PEP 8, SQL style)
- Code organization principles (module structure, import order)

‚ùå **Don't update when:**
- Personal preferences without rationale
- One-off exceptions (context-specific choices)
- Already covered in official language guides

### Automated Documentation (Run Weekly)

- `make update-docs` - Updates timestamps, costs, stats, validates links
- `make sync-progress` - Checks PROGRESS.md vs actual AWS resources
- `make inventory` - Updates FILE_INVENTORY.md with file summaries
- `make check-costs` - Reports current AWS spending

### Monthly Documentation Review Checklist

1. Run all automation: `make update-docs`, `make sync-progress`, `make check-costs`
2. Review stale files (30+ days old) - update or mark as reviewed
3. Verify PROGRESS.md phases match reality (‚úÖ/‚è∏Ô∏è status)
4. Check cost estimates vs actuals in PROGRESS.md
5. Commit: `git commit -m "Monthly documentation refresh - $(date +%Y-%m)"`

## File Inventory Management

### CRITICAL - Always Update FILE_INVENTORY.md When Creating/Modifying Files

**Before `git add .`:** Run `make inventory` to update FILE_INVENTORY.md with new/changed files

**After running `make inventory`:** Review git diff to see what files changed, then document:
- **What you created/modified:** List each file path
- **Why you made the change:** Purpose and problem being solved
- **What error you were resolving:** If fixing a bug, document the error

### Format for Documentation

```markdown
## File Changes - [Date] [Brief Description]

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `path/to/file1.py` - Purpose: Created X function to solve Y problem
- `path/to/file2.md` - Purpose: Documented Z decision (ADR-00X)
- `scripts/shell/file3.sh` - Purpose: Automated W task

**Problem/Error Being Resolved:**
- Error message: [actual error if applicable]
- Root cause: [why it was happening]
- Solution approach: [how files address it]

**Changes Made:**
1. File1: Added/modified X (lines 10-50)
2. File2: Updated Y section with Z information
3. File3: Created new script to automate W
```

**Where to document:** Add to COMMAND_LOG.md (for code changes) and ensure FILE_INVENTORY.md is updated

### Workflow

1. Create/modify files
2. Run `make inventory` (updates FILE_INVENTORY.md automatically)
3. Run `git status` to see all changes
4. Document in COMMAND_LOG.md what you changed and why
5. Then `git add .` and commit

## Documentation System Quick Reference

### Architecture & Decisions

**ADRs** (`docs/adr/README.md`) - Why we made key technical decisions
- ADR-001: Redshift exclusion (saves $200-600/month)
- ADR-002: 10% data extraction (119 GB ‚Üí 12 GB)
- ADR-003: Python 3.11 (Glue compatibility)
- ADR-004: Git without GitHub push (superseded by ADR-005)
- ADR-005: Git SSH authentication
- ADR-006: Session initialization automation
- Use `docs/adr/template.md` for new decisions

### Code Quality

**Style Guide** (`docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`) - Required for all code
- Python: PEP 8, snake_case, type hints required
- SQL: Uppercase keywords, explicit JOINs
- Docstrings required for all functions

**Testing** (`docs/TESTING.md`) - pytest strategy
- Priority: Data validation (scores, dates, required fields)
- Mock AWS with moto library

**Troubleshooting** (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`) - **Check FIRST when errors occur**
- Use grep to find specific errors: `grep -i "error keyword" docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Don't read entire file (1,025 lines)
- 28 documented issues with solutions
- 7 categories: Environment, AWS, Git, ETL, Database, Performance, Security

### Environment & Setup

**Setup Guide** (`docs/SETUP.md`) - Fresh environment setup (11 steps)

**Environment Variables** (`.env.example`) - 35 variables, NEVER commit `.env`

**check_machine_health.sh** - Comprehensive 14-point health check script

### Operational

**QUICKSTART.md** - Daily commands, file locations, quick fixes

**check_costs.sh** - AWS spending monitor (run weekly)

**Documentation Maintenance** (`docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md`)
- Weekly: `update_docs.sh` (auto-updates costs, timestamps, stats)
- Weekly: `sync_progress.py` (checks AWS vs PROGRESS.md)
- Monthly: Review checklist for stale docs
- **NEVER auto-commit** - always review changes
