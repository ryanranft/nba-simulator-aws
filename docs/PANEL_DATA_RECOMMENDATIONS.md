## Next Steps

**Immediate Decision Needed:**
Which approach do you prefer?

### Option A: Comprehensive Implementation (6 weeks, highest impact)
1. Implement all Phase 1 recommendations (weeks 1-3)
2. Add statistical frameworks (weeks 4-5)
3. Redeploy MLOps (week 6)
4. **Expected outcome:** 68-72% accuracy (vs current 63%)

### Option B: Focused Core Implementation (3 weeks, high impact)
1. Implement rec_22 (Panel Data Processing) - Week 1
2. Implement consolidated_rec_11 (Feature Engineering) - Week 2
3. Redeploy MLOps and evaluate - Week 3
4. **Expected outcome:** 65-68% accuracy
5. Decide on additional recommendations based on results

### Option C: Minimal Viable Panel Dataset (1 week, moderate impact)
1. Implement just rec_22 (Panel Data Processing)
2. Redeploy MLOps immediately
3. **Expected outcome:** 64-66% accuracy
4. Iterate based on drift detection results

---

## Recommendation

**Start with Option B: Focused Core Implementation**

**Reasoning:**
1. **rec_22** provides proper panel data structure (foundational)
2. **consolidated_rec_11** adds comprehensive features (highest ML impact)
3. **3 weeks** is manageable time commitment
4. **Redeploy MLOps** validates improvement before continuing
5. **Data-driven decision** on whether to implement remaining recommendations

**Then after evaluating:**
- If accuracy improves significantly (>3%) → Continue with Phase 2 (statistical frameworks)
- If accuracy improves moderately (1-3%) → Focus on data quality (rec_29) next
- If accuracy doesn't improve → Investigate why before continuing
