## Phase 6: Basketball Reference API Workaround (Priority 6)

### Goal
Bypass 403 Forbidden errors and collect real Basketball Reference data to replace mock data.

### Problem Diagnosis
**Current Status:** BLOCKED (403 Forbidden)
**Root Cause:** IP/User-Agent blocking by Basketball Reference

### Fix Strategy

USER_AGENTS = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36...",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36...",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36..."
]
```

**Approach 2: Increased Rate Limiting**
- Current: 12s between requests
- Try: 30s, 60s, 120s between requests

**Approach 3: Session Management**
- Use persistent sessions with cookies
- Rotate sessions periodically

**Approach 4: Proxy Rotation** (if needed)
- Use residential proxies
- Rotate IPs periodically
