# DIMS verification
python scripts/monitoring/dims_cli.py verify

# ADCE status
python scripts/autonomous/autonomous_cli.py status

# Reconciliation test
python scripts/reconciliation/run_reconciliation.py --dry-run
```

### Task 5: Answer Critical Questions
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Priority:** HIGH

These questions must be answered before Phase 2:

#### Q1: What is the `temporal_events` table (5.8 GB)?
**Investigation Steps:**
- [ ] Query table structure
- [ ] Check record count
- [ ] Identify what populates it
- [ ] Determine if it's actively used

**SQL to Run:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM temporal_events;
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('temporal_events'));
SELECT * FROM temporal_events LIMIT 5;
```

#### Q2: Which Phase 8 scripts are actively running?
**Investigation Steps:**
- [ ] Check running processes: `ps aux | grep -i phase | grep python`
- [ ] Review Phase 8 documentation
- [ ] Identify critical scripts
- [ ] Document any dependencies

#### Q3: Is ADCE autonomous loop active?
**Investigation Steps:**
- [ ] Run: `python scripts/autonomous/autonomous_cli.py status`
- [ ] Check cron jobs for ADCE
- [ ] Review last run logs
- [ ] Document operational state

#### Q4: Which scrapers run on schedule?
**Already Documented:**
‚úÖ 4 cron jobs identified:
- Daily audit (9 AM)
- Weekly audit (Monday 9 AM)
- Monthly audit (First Monday 9 AM)
- Odds API quota monitor (hourly)

**Action:**
- [ ] Verify these are the only scheduled jobs
- [ ] Document any Phase 8 or ADCE schedules

---

### Task 6: Create Week 2 Validation Report
**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Document all baseline metrics
- [ ] Answer all 4 critical questions
- [ ] Create comparison with Week 1
- [ ] Identify any issues found
- [ ] Create Week 3 readiness checklist

**Deliverable:**
- `WEEK2_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### If Issues Found
1. **Database connection fails:**
   - Check credentials in .env
   - Verify RDS endpoint accessible
   - Test with psql directly
   - Fall back to old connection method

2. **Existing scripts break:**
   - Document which scripts affected
   - Identify root cause
   - Create compatibility shim if needed
   - Delay Phase 2 until resolved

3. **Data loss detected:**
   - **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
   - Restore from git tag: `pre-refactor-20251028_050228`
   - Investigate root cause
   - Re-implement with additional safeguards
