## Session: 2025-09-30 - GitHub Configuration

### [GIT] Configure Git remote to use SSH
**Time:** 2025-09-30 14:30:00
**Directory:** /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
**Conda Env:** nba-aws
**Command:** `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws.git`
**Output:**
```
(no output - command succeeded silently)
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Exit Code:** 0
**Notes:** Changed from HTTPS to SSH authentication to avoid PAT token issues
**Related:** PROGRESS.md ADR-005

---

### [GIT] Verify SSH authentication

**Directory:** /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
**Conda Env:** nba-aws
**Command:** `ssh -T git@github.com`
**Output:**
```
Hi ryanranft! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Exit Code:** 1 (expected - this is normal for GitHub SSH test)
**Notes:** Exit code 1 is expected; message confirms authentication works
**Related:** PROGRESS.md ADR-005

### [GIT] First push attempt - diverged branches
**Time:** 2025-09-30 14:35:00
**Directory:** /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
**Conda Env:** nba-aws
**Command:** `git push -u origin main`
**Output:**
```
To github.com:ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
```
**Result:** ❌ ERROR
**Exit Code:** 1
**Notes:** Remote had initial commit (70cca1a) not in local history
**Solution:**
1. Fetched remote: `git fetch origin`
2. Rebased local commits: `git pull origin main --rebase`
3. Pushed successfully: `git push -u origin main`

#### Commands Executed

```bash
# Updated file inventory (multiple times)
make inventory
# Result: ✅ SUCCESS - Updated to 36 files

# Created and tested post-commit hook
git add -A
git commit -m "Add automated documentation trigger system"
# Result: ✅ SUCCESS - Hook automatically appended to .session-history.md

# Made setup script executable
chmod +x scripts/shell/setup_git_hooks.sh
# Result: ✅ SUCCESS

# Tested hook setup script
bash scripts/shell/setup_git_hooks.sh
# Result: ✅ SUCCESS - Installed post-commit hook

# Tested session startup script with new docs checks
bash scripts/shell/session_startup.sh
# Result: ✅ SUCCESS - Showed all documentation status checks
```

#### System Design

**Problem Solved:** Manual documentation maintenance
- User had to manually remind Claude to update documentation files
- No automatic signaling when files needed updates
- Risk of forgetting to update FILE_INVENTORY.md, PROGRESS.md, etc.

**Solution Implemented:** Machine-readable trigger system
1. **Trigger Comments:** HTML comments in markdown file headers specify when each file should be updated
2. **Central Registry:** `.documentation-triggers.md` documents all files with triggers
3. **Automated Checks:** `session_startup.sh` checks documentation freshness and warns about stale files
4. **Git Hook:** Post-commit hook automatically logs session state
5. **Bootstrap Script:** Easy hook installation for new environments

**Architecture:**
```
Trigger System
├── Trigger Comments (in each file header)
│   ├── When to update (event description)
│   ├── Frequency (how often)
│   └── Reminder text (what action to take)
├── .documentation-triggers.md (central registry)
│   ├── Automated docs table
│   ├── Manual docs table
│   └── Status check integration
├── session_startup.sh (documentation checks)
│   ├── FILE_INVENTORY.md age check
│   ├── Session history status
│   ├── Command log status
│   ├── PROGRESS.md task counts
│   └── Stale doc detection (30+ days)
└── .git/hooks/post-commit (automation)
    └── Auto-append to .session-history.md
```

**Files with Triggers (9 total):**
1. COMMAND_LOG.md - Update after every code change
2. FILE_INVENTORY.md - Run `make inventory` before `git add .`
3. MACHINE_SPECS.md - Verify at session start
4. PROGRESS.md - Update after completing tasks
5. .session-history.md - Append after every commit (automated via hook)
6. QUICKSTART.md - Update when workflow changes
7. TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Update after solving errors (>10 min)
8. STYLE_GUIDE.md - Update when patterns used 3+ times
9. .documentation-triggers.md - Update when adding new docs

**Testing:**
- ✅ Post-commit hook tested with real commit
- ✅ Session startup script tested with documentation checks
- ✅ Bootstrap script tested and working
- ✅ FILE_INVENTORY.md updated twice successfully
- ✅ All trigger comments added and visible

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Outcome:** Claude will now automatically know when documentation needs updating without manual reminders. The system is comprehensive, testable, and maintainable.

**Lessons Learned:**
1. HTML comments in markdown are perfect for machine-readable metadata (invisible to humans, visible to LLMs)
2. Git hooks must be recreated after cloning (not tracked by Git) - documented in SETUP.md
3. Session startup script is ideal for proactive documentation status checks
4. Central registry (`.documentation-triggers.md`) provides single source of truth
5. Trigger system should reference exact commands to run (e.g., `make inventory`)

**Related Files:**
- `.documentation-triggers.md` - Central registry
- `CLAUDE.md` - References trigger system
- `SETUP.md` - Documents hook setup for new environments
- `scripts/shell/setup_git_hooks.sh` - Automation script

**Next Steps:**
- System is complete and operational
- Monitor effectiveness over next few sessions
- Consider adding more files with triggers as needed
- Possible enhancement: Pre-commit hook to check if FILE_INVENTORY.md needs updating

## Tips for Future Sessions

1. **Start each work session** by logging `git status` and `conda list` to document environment state
2. **Log failed commands immediately** - they're the most valuable learning data
3. **Add "Solution" field** after you resolve an error - helps future debugging
4. **Reference PROGRESS.md sections** to connect commands with project phases
5. **Use categories** consistently to make searching easier
6. **Sanitize before committing** - check for secrets/credentials
