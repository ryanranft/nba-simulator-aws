## Session: 2025-09-30 - GitHub Configuration

### [GIT] Configure Git remote to use SSH
**Time:** 2025-09-30 14:30:00
**Directory:** /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
**Conda Env:** nba-aws
**Command:** `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws.git`
**Output:**
```
(no output - command succeeded silently)
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Exit Code:** 0
**Notes:** Changed from HTTPS to SSH authentication to avoid PAT token issues
**Related:** PROGRESS.md ADR-005

---

### [GIT] Verify SSH authentication
**Time:** 2025-09-30 14:31:00
**Directory:** /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
**Conda Env:** nba-aws
**Command:** `ssh -T git@github.com`
**Output:**
```
Hi ryanranft! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Exit Code:** 1 (expected - this is normal for GitHub SSH test)
**Notes:** Exit code 1 is expected; message confirms authentication works
**Related:** PROGRESS.md ADR-005

### [GIT] First push attempt - diverged branches
**Time:** 2025-09-30 14:35:00
**Directory:** /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
**Conda Env:** nba-aws
**Command:** `git push -u origin main`
**Output:**
```
To github.com:ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
```
**Result:** ❌ ERROR
**Exit Code:** 1
**Notes:** Remote had initial commit (70cca1a) not in local history
**Solution:**
1. Fetched remote: `git fetch origin`
2. Rebased local commits: `git pull origin main --rebase`
3. Pushed successfully: `git push -u origin main`
**Related:** PROGRESS.md ADR-005

---

### [GIT] Rebase local commits on remote
**Time:** 2025-09-30 14:36:00
**Directory:** /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
**Conda Env:** nba-aws
**Command:** `git pull origin main --rebase`
**Output:**
```
From github.com:ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Exit Code:** 0
**Notes:** Rebased local commits (be4afe2, 8253cd5) on top of remote initial commit (70cca1a)
**Related:** PROGRESS.md ADR-005

## Tips for Future Sessions

1. **Start each work session** by logging `git status` and `conda list` to document environment state
2. **Log failed commands immediately** - they're the most valuable learning data
3. **Add "Solution" field** after you resolve an error - helps future debugging
4. **Reference PROGRESS.md sections** to connect commands with project phases
5. **Use categories** consistently to make searching easier
6. **Sanitize before committing** - check for secrets/credentials
