# Overnight S3 Partitioning Status

**Started:** 2025-10-01 22:19:42
**Process ID:** 48440 (wrapper script), 48453 (Python partitioning)
**Log File:** `partition_overnight.log`

---

## What's Running

The automated overnight partitioning script is successfully running and will:

1. ✅ **Partition Schedule Data** (11,633 files) - **IN PROGRESS**
   - Currently on: Year 1993 (100+ of 129 files completed)
   - Estimated: ~10-15 minutes remaining

2. ⏸️ **Partition PBP Data** (44,826 files)
   - Will start automatically after schedule completes
   - Estimated: ~45-60 minutes

3. ⏸️ **Partition Box Scores Data** (44,828 files)
   - Will start automatically after PBP completes
   - Estimated: ~45-60 minutes

4. ⏸️ **Partition Team Stats Data** (44,828 files)
   - Will start automatically after box_scores completes
   - Estimated: ~45-60 minutes

**Total Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for all 146,115 files

## Progress Check Commands

To monitor progress throughout the night or in the morning:

```bash
# Watch live progress (Ctrl+C to exit)
tail -f partition_overnight.log

# Check last 50 lines
tail -50 partition_overnight.log

# Count year folders created (should show 33 per data type when complete)
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/schedule/ | grep "year=" | wc -l
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/pbp/ | grep "year=" | wc -l
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/box_scores/ | grep "year=" | wc -l
aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/team_stats/ | grep "year=" | wc -l

# Check if processes are still running
ps aux | grep partition | grep -v grep

# Check process status by PID
ps -p 48440 48453
```

---

## Expected Final Output

When complete, the log file will show:

```
✅ SUCCESS: schedule partitioning completed
✅ SUCCESS: pbp partitioning completed
✅ SUCCESS: box_scores partitioning completed
✅ SUCCESS: team_stats partitioning completed

ALL PARTITIONING COMPLETE

Verifying S3 structure...
Schedule years: 33
PBP years: 33
Box scores years: 33
Team stats years: 33

✅ Partitioning complete! Ready to create year-based crawlers.
```

## S3 Structure Being Created

```
s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/
├── schedule/
│   ├── year=1993/ (129 files)
│   ├── year=1994/ (365 files)
│   ├── year=1995/ (365 files)
│   └── ... (33 years total)
├── pbp/
│   ├── year=1997/ (~500 files)
│   ├── year=1998/ (~500 files)
│   └── ... (25 years total)
├── box_scores/
│   └── ... (same structure as pbp)
└── team_stats/
    └── ... (same structure as pbp)
```

## What Happens If There's an Error

The script will:
- Continue processing other data types (won't stop entirely)
- Log the error in `partition_overnight.log`
- Show failed data type in the summary

To troubleshoot:
1. Check the log file for error messages
2. Run the failed data type manually:
   ```bash
   echo "yes" | python scripts/etl/partition_by_year.py --data-types <failed_type> --execute
   ```

---

## Next Steps (When Complete)

After partitioning finishes successfully:

### 1. Create Year-Based Crawlers (15-20 min)

```bash
# Create all 132 crawlers (33 years × 4 data types)
./scripts/etl/create_year_crawlers.sh --all

# Or create one data type at a time:
./scripts/etl/create_year_crawlers.sh --data-type schedule --years 1993-2025
```

### 2. Test One Crawler First

```bash
# Start a single crawler for testing
aws glue start-crawler --name nba-schedule-1997-crawler

# Monitor it
aws glue get-crawler --name nba-schedule-1997-crawler

# Check if table created
aws glue get-tables --database-name nba_raw_data --query 'TableList[?Name==`schedule_year_1997`]'
```

### 3. Run All Crawlers (Can Parallelize)

```bash
# Start all schedule crawlers (33 crawlers)
for year in {1993..2025}; do
  aws glue start-crawler --name nba-schedule-${year}-crawler 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Monitor progress
aws glue list-crawlers --query 'CrawlerNames[?contains(@, `schedule`)]' | \
  xargs -I {} aws glue get-crawler --name {} --query 'Crawler.State'
```

### 4. Update PROGRESS.md

Mark Phase 2.1 tasks as complete:
- ✅ Partition S3 data by year
- ✅ Create year-based crawlers
- ⏳ Run crawlers (in progress)

## Cost Impact

**S3 Operations:**
- 146,115 copy operations (within same bucket)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10-0.15
- No data transfer charges (same region, same bucket)

**Glue Crawlers (when you run them):**
- 132 crawlers × ~5 min each = ~11 hours total
- Can run 10 in parallel = ~1 hour real time
- Estimated cost: ~$1.10 (132 crawlers × 5 min × $0.44/hour)

**Total additional monthly cost:** <$0.10 (one-time partitioning cost)

## Verification Checklist

When you wake up, verify:

- [ ] Processes completed (check log file for "ALL PARTITIONING COMPLETE")
- [ ] No error messages in log
- [ ] 33 year folders exist for each data type in S3
- [ ] Process IDs 48440 and 48453 are no longer running
- [ ] Ready to create year-based crawlers

**Note:** This process will run to completion without user intervention. The `nohup` wrapper ensures it continues even if your terminal disconnects or your computer sleeps. The process writes all output to `partition_overnight.log` for review in the morning.
