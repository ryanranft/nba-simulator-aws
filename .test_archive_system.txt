# Test Archive System

This is a test file to verify the conversation archiving system works correctly.

Created: 2025-10-02
Purpose: Test that conversations are being saved to appropriate directories with correct SHA mappings

## What This Tests

1. Conversation export to CHAT_LOG.md
2. Archive script execution
3. Creation of original/sanitized versions
4. Proper directory structure
5. SHA-based naming

## Expected Result

After committing this file and running the archive script:
- chat-<NEW_SHA>-original.md should be created
- chat-<NEW_SHA>-sanitized.md should be created
- Files should be in ~/sports-simulator-archives/nba/conversations/
- This NEW_SHA will be the actual commit SHA (post any git operations)

## Cleanup

This file can be deleted after testing is complete.
