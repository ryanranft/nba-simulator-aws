# CLAUDE.md

**Version:** 2.0 (Modular Documentation System)
**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025 - 11:30 PM
**System Status:** 8 phases (2 with enhancement plans), 38 workflows, 97+ workflow references

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workflow Order - Follow This Sequence

**See `docs/claude_workflows/CLAUDE_WORKFLOW_ORDER.md` for workflow index and execution order.**

**All detailed workflows are in: `docs/claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/`**

**System now contains 38 modular workflows:**
- üöÄ Session Start & End workflows (#1, #14)
- üìã Decision & Plan Change workflows
- üíª Task Execution & File Creation workflows
- üîí Git Commit & Push workflows (security protocols)
- üß™ Testing workflows (TDD, unit, integration, pre-deployment)
- üîß Environment Setup & Verification workflows
- üí∞ Cost Management workflows (before creating, tracking, optimization)
- üíæ Backup & Recovery workflows
- üîÑ Maintenance Schedule workflows (weekly, monthly)
- üìä Data Validation workflows (pre-ETL, pre-simulation, pre-ML)
- üîç Systematic Troubleshooting Protocol
- üîê Credential Rotation workflows
- ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Resource Setup workflows (Glue, RDS, EC2, SageMaker)
- üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration workflows
- üîß Makefile Quick Reference
- üåô **Overnight Scraper Handoff Protocol (#38)** - NEW

**Navigation pattern:**
```
1. Read PROGRESS.md (identify current task/phase)
2. Read docs/claude_workflows/CLAUDE_WORKFLOW_ORDER.md (find relevant workflow number)
3. Read docs/claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/XX_workflow_name.md (get detailed steps)
4. Execute workflow steps
```

**Quick reference - Every session follows this order:**
1. Initialize session (`session_manager.sh start`) - show output to user
2. Orient to current state (read PROGRESS.md)
3. **üåô Check overnight jobs** (if "Overnight jobs running" section exists in PROGRESS.md):
   - Follow Workflow #38: Overnight Scraper Handoff Protocol
   - Check process status, logs, output files
   - Document results or failure
4. Ask about completed work
5. Wait for user's task request
6. Follow decision workflow (check plan, prerequisites, costs, risks)
7. Execute task ‚Üí Document outcome ‚Üí Wait for confirmation
8. Update PROGRESS.md ‚Üí Suggest next action
9. Follow security protocol for commits/pushes
10. Monitor context (auto-save at 75%, warn at 90%)

**Critical decision points:**
- **Skipping ahead?** ‚Üí Check prerequisites, warn if missing
- **Changing the plan?** ‚Üí Update PROGRESS.md first, get approval
- **Will it cost money?** ‚Üí Warn with estimate, get confirmation
- **Could it break something?** ‚Üí Explain risk, suggest backup/test approach
- **Command fails?** ‚Üí Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md, stop, ask for guidance

**How workflows integrate with PROGRESS.md:**

**‚úÖ NEW MODULAR STRUCTURE (Implemented Oct 2, 2025):**
- PROGRESS.md is now a lightweight index (~350 lines, was 1,244 lines)
- Individual phase files in `docs/phases/` contain detailed implementation steps
- Phase files explicitly reference workflow numbers (e.g., "Follow workflow #24")
- Clear hierarchy: PROGRESS.md ‚Üí Phase file ‚Üí Workflow file

**Phase files:**
- PHASE_0_DATA_COLLECTION.md (complete)
- PHASE_1_DATA_QUALITY.md (ready to implement - multi-source integration planned)
- PHASE_2_AWS_GLUE.md (complete)
- PHASE_3_DATABASE.md (complete)
- PHASE_4_SIMULATION_ENGINE.md (complete - advanced simulation framework planned)
- PHASE_5_MACHINE_LEARNING.md (complete)
- PHASE_6_ENHANCEMENTS.md (complete)
- PHASE_7_BETTING_ODDS.md (pending - optional future enhancement)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Read only what you need (72% reduction in PROGRESS.md size)
- ‚úÖ Faster file operations (350 lines vs 1,244)
- ‚úÖ Reduced context usage (90%+ savings)
- ‚úÖ Easier maintenance (update one phase without affecting others)
- ‚úÖ Scalable (easy to add new phases)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns

## Navigation Between PROGRESS.md and Phase Files

**PROGRESS.md serves as the master index** - it shows high-level status and directs to detailed phase files.

**Navigation pattern:**
1. Read PROGRESS.md (identify current task/phase)
2. Follow link to specific phase file (e.g., `docs/phases/PHASE_3_DATABASE.md`)
3. Read phase file for detailed implementation steps and workflow references
4. Follow workflow links to `docs/claude_workflows/workflow_descriptions/XX_workflow_name.md`
5. Execute workflow steps

**Always start with PROGRESS.md** to understand:
- Current phase status (‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING, üîÑ IN PROGRESS, ‚úÖ COMPLETE)
- What was completed in previous session
- What user wants to work on next
- Cost implications of next steps

---

## Phase File Reading Protocol

**Before starting any phase work:**
1. Read PROGRESS.md to identify current phase
2. Read the full phase file (e.g., `docs/phases/PHASE_3_DATABASE.md`)
3. Check for the "‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Before Starting This Phase" note
4. If present, ask user: "Should I add any workflows to this phase before beginning?"
5. Review existing workflow references in the phase file
6. Follow workflow execution order as specified in phase file

**During phase work:**
- Reference phase file for step-by-step instructions
- Follow workflow links for detailed procedures
- Update phase file status markers as work progresses
- Log commands to COMMAND_LOG.md per workflow #2

---

## Decision Tree for File Reading

**User says "let's work on [task]":**
1. Is it a new session? ‚Üí Run `session_manager.sh start` first
2. Read PROGRESS.md ‚Üí Find which phase contains this task
3. Read the specific phase file completely
4. Check for workflow recommendations needed
5. Execute task following phase file + workflows
6. Update PROGRESS.md status when phase/sub-phase completes

**User says "continue where we left off":**
1. Run `session_manager.sh start`
2. Read PROGRESS.md ‚Üí Find first üîÑ IN PROGRESS or ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING phase
3. Read that phase file completely
4. Ask user what they completed since last session
5. Update status accordingly
6. Suggest next sub-phase to work on

**User says "start Phase X":**
1. Read `docs/phases/PHASE_X_NAME.md` completely
2. Check for "‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT" note at top
3. If present, ask: "Should I add any workflows to this phase before beginning?"
4. Wait for approval before proceeding
5. Follow phase file instructions step by step

---

## Context Management with Modular Docs

**Why this matters:**
- Old PROGRESS.md: 9,533 lines (massive context usage)
- New system: Average 400 lines per file (90%+ context savings)

**Context-efficient reading strategy:**
1. **Always read PROGRESS.md first** (350 lines) - establishes orientation
2. **Read only the relevant phase file** (400-600 lines) - get detailed steps
3. **Read only the workflows referenced in current sub-phase** (200-400 lines each)
4. **Don't read all phase files at once** - wait for user to specify which phase

**Example efficient session:**
- Read PROGRESS.md: 350 lines
- Read PHASE_3_DATABASE.md: 450 lines
- Read Workflow #32 (RDS Connection): 300 lines
- **Total: 1,100 lines vs 9,533 lines (88% savings)**

**When to read multiple files:**
- User explicitly asks to review all phases
- Working on cross-phase documentation updates
- Creating new workflows that span multiple phases
- Otherwise: Read only what's needed for current task

---

## PROGRESS.md Update Protocol

**When to update PROGRESS.md:**
- ‚úÖ When completing a sub-phase (update status from ‚è∏Ô∏è to ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ When starting a new phase (update status from ‚è∏Ô∏è to üîÑ)
- ‚úÖ At session end (update "Current Session Context")
- ‚ùå Don't update for minor tasks or intermediate steps

**What to update in PROGRESS.md:**
1. Phase/sub-phase status emoji (‚è∏Ô∏è ‚Üí üîÑ ‚Üí ‚úÖ)
2. "Started" and "Completed" dates in phase summary
3. "Current Session Context" section
4. Link to newly created phase file (if applicable)

**What NOT to update in PROGRESS.md:**
- Detailed implementation steps (those belong in phase files)
- Workflow procedures (those belong in workflow files)
- Command outputs (those belong in COMMAND_LOG.md)

---

## Consistency Check Before Session End

**Before running Workflow #14 (Session End), verify:**
- [ ] PROGRESS.md status matches actual completion state
- [ ] Phase file status matches PROGRESS.md
- [ ] "Current Session Context" in PROGRESS.md is updated
- [ ] New workflow references added to phase files if needed
- [ ] COMMAND_LOG.md updated with session commands
- [ ] All files saved and no unsaved changes

**If inconsistencies found:**
1. Update PROGRESS.md first (master index)
2. Then update phase files to match
3. Then commit changes with clear message

---

## Creating New Phase Files

**If you need to create a new phase file (rare):**

Use this template structure:
```markdown
# Phase X: [Name]

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
**Prerequisites:** [List]
**Estimated Time:** [Hours]
**Estimated Cost:** [$/month]

---

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Before Starting This Phase:**
>
> **Ask Claude:** "Should I add any workflows to this phase before beginning?"

---

## File Reading Efficiency Metrics

**Track your context usage:**

**Inefficient approach (old way):**
- Read all of PROGRESS.md: 9,533 lines
- Read all workflows at once: 13,212 lines (36 workflows)
- **Total: 22,745 lines** ‚ùå

**Efficient approach (new way):**
- Read CLAUDE.md: 291 lines
- Read PROGRESS.md: 380 lines
- Read relevant phase file: 450 lines
- Read 2-3 relevant workflows: 600-900 lines
- **Total: 1,721-2,021 lines** ‚úÖ

**Context savings: 91-92%**

**Remember:**
- Don't read files "just in case"
- Don't read all phases when working on one
- Don't read all workflows upfront
- Do read incrementally as needed

---

## Session Startup Checklist

**Every new session, follow this exact sequence:**

1. ‚úÖ Read CLAUDE.md (this file) - orient to the system
2. ‚úÖ Read PROGRESS.md - identify current phase and last session's work
3. ‚úÖ Check "Current Session Context" in PROGRESS.md
4. ‚úÖ Ask user: "What did you complete since our last session?"
5. ‚úÖ Update PROGRESS.md "Current Session Context" based on user response
6. ‚úÖ Ask user: "What would you like to work on today?"
7. ‚úÖ Read relevant phase file for the task
8. ‚úÖ Check for "‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT" note at top of phase file
9. ‚úÖ If present, ask about adding workflows before proceeding
10. ‚úÖ Begin work following phase file + workflow references

**Do NOT:**
- ‚ùå Read all phase files at once
- ‚ùå Read all workflows upfront
- ‚ùå Start work before asking user what they completed
- ‚ùå Skip the "Current Session Context" update

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Context management mistakes:**
1. ‚ùå Reading all 6 phase files when user wants to work on Phase 4
   - ‚úÖ Only read PHASE_4 file
2. ‚ùå Reading workflows 1-36 at session start "just in case"
   - ‚úÖ Read workflows only when referenced in current sub-phase
3. ‚ùå Re-reading files you already read in this session
   - ‚úÖ Keep track of what you've read, don't re-read unnecessarily

**Documentation update mistakes:**
1. ‚ùå Updating phase files with detailed implementation notes
   - ‚úÖ Phase files contain planning, COMMAND_LOG.md contains execution
2. ‚ùå Forgetting to update "Current Session Context" at session end
   - ‚úÖ Always update before running Workflow #14 (Session End)
3. ‚ùå Marking sub-phase complete when errors occurred
   - ‚úÖ Only mark complete when fully successful

**Navigation mistakes:**
1. ‚ùå Starting work without checking prerequisites in phase file
   - ‚úÖ Always verify prerequisites before starting phase
2. ‚ùå Skipping the "Should I add workflows?" question for pending phases
   - ‚úÖ Always ask when you see the ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT note
3. ‚ùå Not following workflow execution order specified in phase file
   - ‚úÖ Follow workflows in the order listed

## File Size Reference (Context Planning)

**Know before you read:**

| File | Lines | Read Time | When to Read |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| CLAUDE.md | ~550 | Always | Every session start |
| PROGRESS.md | ~410 | Always | Every session start |
| PHASE_1 | ~300 | As needed | Working on Phase 1 |
| PHASE_2 | ~345 | As needed | Working on Phase 2 |
| PHASE_3 | ~407 | As needed | Working on Phase 3 |
| PHASE_4 | ~485 | As needed | Working on Phase 4 |
| PHASE_5 | ~489 | As needed | Working on Phase 5 |
| PHASE_6 | ~427 | As needed | Working on Phase 6 |
| Workflow (avg) | ~300 | As needed | Referenced in phase |

**Typical session context usage:**
- Minimal session: 960 lines (CLAUDE.md + PROGRESS.md)
- Light work: 1,750 lines (+ 1 phase file)
- Moderate work: 2,350 lines (+ 1 phase + 2 workflows)
- Heavy work: 3,200 lines (+ 2 phases + 3 workflows)

**Maximum recommended:** 4,000 lines per session (stay well under 200K token limit)

---

## Quick Reference Card

**Copy this to start of every response when you're uncertain:**

```
Session checklist:
[ ] Read CLAUDE.md ‚úì
[ ] Read PROGRESS.md ‚úì
[ ] Asked user what they completed
[ ] Updated "Current Session Context"
[ ] Asked user what they want to work on
[ ] Read relevant phase file
[ ] Checked for workflow recommendations
[ ] Ready to begin work
```

**Decision points:**
- User wants to work on [task] ‚Üí Which phase? ‚Üí Read that phase file
- Phase file says "Follow workflow #X" ‚Üí Read workflow #X
- Workflow says "Log to COMMAND_LOG.md" ‚Üí Use Workflow #2
- Task complete ‚Üí Update PROGRESS.md ‚Üí Run Workflow #14
- Session ending ‚Üí Consistency check ‚Üí Update context ‚Üí Commit if needed

---

## Emergency Recovery

**If something goes wrong mid-session:**

### Lost context / confused about state:
1. Stop immediately
2. Re-read PROGRESS.md "Current Session Context"
3. Re-read current phase file
4. Ask user: "Where were we? What's the current state?"
5. Resume from a known-good checkpoint

### Made changes to wrong file:
1. Check git status: `git status`
2. Review changes: `git diff`
3. If wrong, revert: `git checkout -- <file>`
4. Apologize to user, explain what happened
5. Start over with correct file

### Updated PROGRESS.md incorrectly:
1. Check git diff for PROGRESS.md
2. Compare against phase file status
3. If mismatch, revert and update correctly
4. Always update PROGRESS.md last (after phase work)

### Forgot to log commands:
1. Recreate command history from bash history
2. Add to COMMAND_LOG.md retroactively
3. Note that it was added retroactively
4. Set reminder to log commands in real-time next time

## Project Overview

**This is a temporal panel data system, not a traditional sports analytics project.**

See `docs/PROJECT_VISION.md` for the authoritative project vision and goals.
See `README.md` for quick start, architecture, and current status.

**Core capability:** Query cumulative NBA statistics at any exact moment in time with millisecond precision.

**Example:** "What were Kobe Bryant's career statistics at exactly 7:02:34.56 PM CT on June 19, 2016?"

## Essential Setup

See `docs/SETUP.md` for complete environment setup and verification.

**Quick activation:**
```bash
conda activate nba-aws
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
```

## Critical Paths

See `docs/SETUP.md` for complete project paths and directory structure.

**Most critical:**
- **Project:** `/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws`
- **S3 Bucket:** `s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake` (146,115 files)
- **Archives:** `~/sports-simulator-archives/nba/`

## Architecture

See `README.md` for complete 5-phase pipeline architecture and key architectural decisions.

## Git & GitHub Configuration

See `QUICKSTART.md` for Git commands and `docs/SECURITY_PROTOCOLS.md` for complete security procedures.

**CRITICAL - Before ANY Git Operation:**

- **Before commit:** Run security scan (see `docs/SECURITY_PROTOCOLS.md` for scan commands and protocols)
- **Before push:** Run `scripts/shell/pre_push_inspector.sh full` (7-step automated workflow)
- **NEVER commit without security scan** - check for AWS keys, secrets, IPs, passwords
- **NEVER push without user approval** - always ask "Ready to push to GitHub?"
- **If hook blocks commit/push:** Show user flagged lines, explain findings, get explicit bypass approval

See `docs/SECURITY_PROTOCOLS.md` for:
- Complete security scan bash commands
- Whitelist patterns (safe vs unsafe)
- Security check protocol (step-by-step)
- Pre-push inspection workflow (repository cleanup)
- Credential rotation schedules
- GitHub secret scanning setup

## Common Commands

See `QUICKSTART.md` for all common commands (S3, database, AWS resources, daily workflow).

## Data Structure

See `docs/DATA_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` for complete S3 bucket layout, data extraction strategy, and file characteristics.

## Important Notes

**AWS Configuration & Credentials:** See `docs/SETUP.md`

**Cost Awareness (IMPORTANT):**
- **Current:** $2.74/month (S3 storage only)
- **Full deployment:** $95-130/month
- **Budget target:** $150/month
- **ALWAYS warn user before creating:**
  - RDS instances (~$29/month)
  - EC2 instances (~$5-15/month)
  - Glue jobs (~$13/month)
  - SageMaker notebooks (~$50/month)

See `PROGRESS.md` for complete cost breakdowns.

**Data Safety Protocol:**
- NEVER delete or modify S3 bucket contents without explicit user request
- NEVER drop database tables without user confirmation
- NEVER commit `.env`, credentials, or sensitive data
- Backup before destructive operations

See `docs/SECURITY_PROTOCOLS.md` for complete security procedures.

## Next Steps

See `PROGRESS.md` for detailed phase-by-phase implementation plan with time estimates, cost breakdowns, and step-by-step instructions.

## Development Workflow
