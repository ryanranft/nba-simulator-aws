# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Decision Tree

**When user asks to do something:**
1. **Is it the next pending task in PROGRESS.md?** ‚Üí Proceed
2. **Is it skipping ahead?** ‚Üí Check prerequisites first, warn if missing
3. **Is it changing the plan?** ‚Üí Update PROGRESS.md first, get approval
4. **Will it cost money?** ‚Üí Warn user with estimate, get confirmation
5. **Could it break something?** ‚Üí Explain risk, suggest backup/test approach

**During the session:**
1. **Is context at 75%+?** ‚Üí Auto-save conversation to CHAT_LOG.md immediately
2. **Is context at 90%+?** ‚Üí Strongly urge user to commit NOW
3. **User says "save this conversation"?** ‚Üí Write verbatim transcript to CHAT_LOG.md

**When a command fails:**
1. Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for known solution
2. If unknown, STOP and ask user for guidance
3. Don't attempt multiple fixes automatically
4. Log solution with `log_solution` after resolving

## Git & GitHub Configuration

See `QUICKSTART.md` for Git commands and `docs/SECURITY_PROTOCOLS.md` for security procedures.

**CRITICAL - Security Protocol Before ANY Git Commit:**

Before running `git commit`, ALWAYS perform automatic security scan:

```bash
# Step 1: Check staged files for sensitive data (comprehensive pattern)
git diff --staged | grep -E "(AWS_ACCESS_KEY[A-Z0-9]{16}|aws_secret|secret_access_key|aws_session_token|password|api[_-]?key|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9_-]+|BEGIN [REDACTED] KEY|ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}|github_pat|postgres:|postgresql://.*:.*@|192\.168\.|10\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])\.)" -i

# Step 2: Check commit message for sensitive data
grep -E "(AWS_ACCESS_KEY|aws_secret|password|192\.168\.|10\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])\.)" .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG -i

# Step 3: If ANY matches found:
#   - STOP immediately
#   - Show matches to user
#   - NEVER commit AWS keys, secrets, or private IPs under any circumstances
#   - Remove sensitive data or abort commit

# Step 4: What to check for:
#   ‚ùå AWS access keys (AWS_ACCESS_KEY[A-Z0-9]{16})
#   ‚ùå AWS secret keys (aws_secret_access_key)
#   ‚ùå AWS session tokens (aws_session_token)
#   ‚ùå Private IP addresses (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x)
#   ‚ùå ANY IP addresses (per user requirement)
#   ‚ùå Passwords, API keys, Bearer tokens
#   ‚ùå SSH private keys (BEGIN + PRIVATE + KEY)
#   ‚ùå GitHub tokens (ghp_..., github_pat_...)
#   ‚ùå Database connection strings with passwords (postgresql://user:pass@host)
```

**Whitelist - Safe patterns (don't trigger false positives):**
```bash
# These are OK in documentation:
‚úÖ Placeholder examples: "<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_HERE>", "your-access-key-here", "<INSERT_KEY_HERE>"
‚úÖ Documentation keywords: describing what to check for (like this list)
‚úÖ Redacted credentials: [REDACTED], [Private network], [Router]
‚úÖ Environment variable format: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= (without value)
‚úÖ Public DNS: Not allowed per user requirement (remove ALL IPs)

# NEVER use these placeholders (trigger security scanners):
‚ùå AWS_ACCESS_KEY**************** (still contains AWS_ACCESS_KEY prefix)
‚ùå Any pattern starting with AWS_ACCESS_KEY, even if redacted
```

**Security Check Protocol:**
1. Run grep scan BEFORE staging files
2. **If matches found: STOP immediately and show user:**
   ```bash
   # Save diff to temp file
   git diff --staged > /tmp/staged_diff.txt

   # Show ALL flagged lines with line numbers
   grep -n -E "(pattern)" -i /tmp/staged_diff.txt

   # Show FULL CONTEXT (10 lines before/after each match)
   grep -E "(pattern)" -i -B 10 -A 10 /tmp/staged_diff.txt
   ```
3. **Present to user:**
   - Show flagged line numbers
   - Show full context around each match
   - Explain what was detected (pattern definitions vs actual secrets)
   - Explain if deletions (safe) or additions (review needed)
   - **Ask explicitly:** "Do you approve bypassing pre-commit hook? [YES/NO]"
4. **Wait for user's explicit YES or NO response**
5. Only proceed with `--no-verify` if user responds YES
6. NEVER assume approval - always ask first

**CRITICAL: NEVER use --no-verify without:**
- ‚úÖ Showing user ALL flagged lines with full context
- ‚úÖ Explaining what was flagged and why
- ‚úÖ Getting explicit YES approval from user

**NEVER commit without this security check.**

**Commit format (include co-authorship footer):**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Common Commands

See `QUICKSTART.md` for all common commands (S3, database, AWS resources, daily workflow).

## Data Structure

See `docs/DATA_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` for complete S3 bucket layout, data extraction strategy, and file characteristics.

## Important Notes

**AWS Configuration & Credentials:** See `docs/SETUP.md`

**Cost Awareness (IMPORTANT):**
- **Current:** $2.74/month (S3 storage only)
- **Full deployment:** $95-130/month
- **Budget target:** $150/month
- **ALWAYS warn user before creating:**
  - RDS instances (~$29/month)
  - EC2 instances (~$5-15/month)
  - Glue jobs (~$13/month)
  - SageMaker notebooks (~$50/month)

See `PROGRESS.md` for complete cost breakdowns.

**Data Safety Protocol:**
- NEVER delete or modify S3 bucket contents without explicit user request
- NEVER drop database tables without user confirmation
- NEVER commit `.env`, credentials, or sensitive data
- Backup before destructive operations

See `docs/SECURITY_PROTOCOLS.md` for complete security procedures.

## Next Steps

See `PROGRESS.md` for detailed phase-by-phase implementation plan with time estimates, cost breakdowns, and step-by-step instructions.

## Development Workflow

See `QUICKSTART.md` for complete daily workflow, maintenance commands, archive management, and Makefile commands.
