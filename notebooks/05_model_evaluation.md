This notebook will provide comprehensive model comparison and evaluation.

**To be created when you execute notebooks 02-04 and have actual model results to compare.**

**Contents will include:**
- Load all trained models from S3
- Side-by-side performance comparison
- ROC curves for all models
- Confusion matrices
- Feature importance comparison
- Model selection recommendations
- Production deployment guidance

**For now, use notebooks 03 and 04 which include their own evaluation sections.**
