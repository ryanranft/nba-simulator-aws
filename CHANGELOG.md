## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added - Phase 4: EC2 Simulation Engine

**Infrastructure:**
- EC2 t3.small instance deployed (i-0b8bbe4cdff7ae2d2) running Amazon Linux 2023
- SSH key pair created: `nba-simulator-ec2-key` with 400 permissions
- Security group configured (sg-0b9ca09f4a041e1c8) for SSH access from specific IP
- RDS security group updated to allow EC2 connections via source-group reference
- Python 3.11.13 installed with scientific computing packages (boto3, pandas, psycopg2, numpy, scipy)
- PostgreSQL 15.14 client installed for database testing

**Simulation Engine:**
- `db_connection.py`: Database interface class with methods for team statistics, head-to-head matchups, and recent games
- `simulate_game.py`: Monte Carlo simulator using normal distribution scoring model
  - Home court advantage: +3.0 points
  - Standard deviation: 12.0 points
  - Command-line interface with argparse
  - CSV result export functionality
- `~/nba-simulation/README.md`: Complete simulation methodology documentation (3.9 KB)
- Environment configuration with auto-loading credentials from `~/.env`

**Testing & Validation:**
- Tested LAL vs BOS simulation: 54.1% win probability (1,000 iterations)
- Tested GSW vs MIA simulation: 58.1% win probability (5,000 iterations)
- Database connectivity verified: 44,828 games, 6,781,155 play-by-play rows
- Performance validated: 5,000 iterations complete in ~5-8 seconds

**Workflows:**
- Created Workflow #37: Credential Management
  - Step-by-step guide for adding AWS resource credentials
  - Templates for EC2, RDS, S3, SageMaker credentials
  - Security best practices (chmod 600, .gitignore, rotation schedules)
  - Troubleshooting section for common credential issues

**Documentation:**
- Updated `PHASE_4_SIMULATION_ENGINE.md` with comprehensive "What Actually Happened" section
  - Actual commands executed with real resource IDs
  - Critical insights: what worked well vs. what didn't
  - Lessons learned for Phase 5
  - Actual time breakdown (3 hours total)
- Updated `PROGRESS.md`:
  - Phase 4 marked as COMPLETE (Oct 3, 2025)
  - Current cost updated to $38.33/month (S3 + RDS + EC2)
  - Executive summary updated with Phase 4 accomplishments
  - Success criteria marked complete
- Updated `/Users/ryanranft/nba-sim-credentials.env` with EC2 configuration section

**Cost Impact:**
- Added $6.59/month for EC2 t3.small (8 hrs/day usage pattern)
- Total project cost: $38.33/month (within $150 budget)

### Changed
- Phase 4 status: PENDING ‚Üí COMPLETE
- System now has 37 workflows (added Workflow #37)
- 4 of 6 phases complete (Phases 1-4)

### Technical Details
- **Database Schema Validation:** Verified actual column names (`home_team_abbrev`, not `home_team_abbreviation`)
- **Security Groups:** Used source-group references instead of IP ranges for EC2-RDS communication
- **Package Installation:** Used `--user` flag for pip to avoid permission issues
- **Environment Persistence:** Auto-load `~/.env` in `.bashrc` for persistent environment

### Lessons Learned
1. Always check database schema with `\d table_name` before writing queries
2. Use `aws ec2 wait` commands for instance state changes
3. Security groups work better with source-group references than IP ranges
4. Test database connections with both psql AND Python before deploying code
5. Document all resource IDs immediately after creation
