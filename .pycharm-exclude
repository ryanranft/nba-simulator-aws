# PyCharm Memory Optimization - Excluded Directories
# ===================================================
# These directories are excluded from PyCharm indexing to improve performance
# Last Updated: 2025-11-08 (CRITICAL UPDATE)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: JSON Data Files (146,115+ files, 119+ GB) ⚠️
data/
# THIS IS THE LARGEST DIRECTORY AND MUST BE EXCLUDED
# Contains raw NBA data in JSON format from ESPN scraping
# PyCharm will crash or become unusable if it tries to index this
# Without this exclusion, PyCharm will attempt to index 146,115+ files!

## Large Log Directories (537+ MB)
logs/
logs/archived_logs/

## Test Coverage Reports (20+ MB)
htmlcov/
.coverage
coverage.json
.pytest_cache/

## ML Experiment Tracking (can be large)
mlruns/
mlartifacts/

## Backup Directories
backups/
backup_api_scrapes/
nba_simulator.backup.*/
nba-simulator-refactored/

## Temporary Files
tmp/
synthesis_output/

## Archives
archives/

## Why This Matters:
# PyCharm indexes all files in the project by default. Without excluding data/,
# PyCharm tries to index 146,115+ JSON files (119+ GB), which causes:
# - Complete memory exhaustion (8+ GB used)
# - 30+ minute indexing times (or complete hangs)
# - Completely unusable IDE
# - Frequent crashes

## How to Apply:
# 1. These directories are already configured in .idea/nba-simulator-aws.iml
# 2. Restart PyCharm after updating this file
# 3. Run ./pycharm_memory_cleanup.sh to remove large files
# 4. PyCharm will re-index (much faster)

## Maintenance:
# Run weekly: ./pycharm_memory_cleanup.sh
# This moves backups and archives old logs automatically
