Panel Data Team Aggregator

Purpose: Replace simple linear aggregation (sum/average) with sophisticated
         panel data aggregations that capture temporal context and non-linear effects

Problem (identified by user):
    "Team stats is not using the same engines we are in this model.
     The team stats category is probably assuming linearity of players playing."

Solution:
    - Use panel data features (lag + rolling) instead of current game stats
    - Apply 5 aggregation functions: mean, std, max, min, sum
    - Separate home/away teams
    - Create matchup features (home - away differentials)
    - Capture non-linear effects through std, max, min

    Sophisticated team-level aggregation using panel data features.

    Key Differences from Simple Aggregation:

    Traditional (Linear) Approach:
    ```python
    team_points = sum(player_points)  # Simple linear sum
    team_avg = mean(player_stats)     # Simple average
    ```

    Panel Data Approach:
    ```python
    # Uses historical context (lag + rolling)
    team_features = aggregate(
        panel_features=['points_lag1', 'points_rolling_3_mean', ...],
        agg_funcs=['mean', 'std', 'max', 'min', 'sum']
    )
    # Result: 300 features × 5 aggs × 2 teams = 3,000 game-level features
    ```

    Benefits:
    - Temporal context: Uses historical trends, not just current game
    - Non-linear effects: Captures variance (std), extremes (max, min)
    - Team separation: Home/away treated independently
    - Matchup features: Direct comparisons (home - away)
