Panel Data Integration Layer

Purpose: Integrate sophisticated panel data engine (84% accuracy, 300 temporal features)
         with existing feature extraction infrastructure (229+ static features)

Key Features:
- Extends UnifiedFeatureExtractor with panel data capabilities
- Provides 529+ total features (229 static + 300 temporal)
- Backward compatible with existing code
- Supports both player-level and game-level aggregations
