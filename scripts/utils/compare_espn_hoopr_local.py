Compare ESPN vs hoopR Local Databases

Cross-validates ESPN and hoopR data sources using local SQLite databases
BEFORE loading to RDS PostgreSQL. Follows established pattern: validate
locally first, load to cloud with confidence.

Pattern established in:
- scripts/utils/compare_espn_databases.py (ESPN local vs RDS)
- docs/ESPN_SCRAPER_GUIDE.md (local-first validation)

This script identifies:
- Game overlap (2002-2025 shared coverage)
- Event count discrepancies
- Complementary data (hoopR fills ESPN gaps)
- Data quality differences
- Systematic gaps by season/team

Usage:
    # Fast summary (recommended)
    python scripts/utils/compare_espn_hoopr_local.py

    # Detailed game-by-game comparison
    python scripts/utils/compare_espn_hoopr_local.py --detailed

    # Export findings to CSV
    python scripts/utils/compare_espn_hoopr_local.py --export-report

Prerequisites:
    1. ESPN local database exists: /tmp/espn_local.db
    2. hoopR local database exists: /tmp/hoopr_local.db

Create databases first:
    python scripts/db/create_local_espn_database.py
    python scripts/db/create_local_hoopr_database.py

Output:
    - Summary report showing overlap and gaps
    - Optional: Detailed game-by-game comparison
    - Optional: CSV export for further analysis

Version: 1.0
Created: October 9, 2025
Pattern: Cross-source local validation (reusable for NBA API, Basketball Ref)

Examples:
  # Fast summary (recommended)
  python scripts/utils/compare_espn_hoopr_local.py

  # Detailed game-by-game comparison
  python scripts/utils/compare_espn_hoopr_local.py --detailed

  # Export validation report
  python scripts/utils/compare_espn_hoopr_local.py --export-report

Prerequisites:
  1. ESPN database: python scripts/db/create_local_espn_database.py
  2. hoopR database: python scripts/db/create_local_hoopr_database.py

Pattern:
  Local validation BEFORE cloud operations!
  - Fast (no network latency)
  - Free ($0 cost)
  - Catch issues early
  - High confidence before RDS load
