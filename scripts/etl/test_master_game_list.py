Test Master Game List Builder

Tests the robust scraper across different eras to validate it finds
the correct number of games. Run this overnight when rate limits reset.

Usage:
    python scripts/etl/test_master_game_list.py
    python scripts/etl/test_master_game_list.py --verbose

Expected Results:
    1947 (BAA first season):  ~60 games (short season)
    1955 (Pre-shot-clock):    ~108 games (8 teams √ó 72 games / 2)
    1990 (Pre-expansion):     ~1,179 games
    2000 (Modern 30 teams):   ~1,264 games
    2010 (Modern full):       ~1,312 games
    2023 (Most recent):       ~1,320 games
