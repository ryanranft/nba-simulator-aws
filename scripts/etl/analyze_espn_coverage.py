ESPN Coverage Analysis Script

Analyzes the loaded ESPN PBP data to generate accurate coverage reports.
Queries PostgreSQL to determine actual vs expected games per season.

This script addresses the 106.2% coverage issue by:
1. Using correct NBA season logic
2. Only counting NBA games (30 teams)
3. Calculating accurate coverage percentages
4. Identifying missing games for targeted scraping
