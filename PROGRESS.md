### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Temporal-specific:**
1. **Snapshot frequency tuning:**
   - Baseline: Every game (18M snapshots)
   - Optional: Every quarter (+50K/season)
   - **Tradeoff:** More snapshots = faster queries, higher cost

2. **Archive old snapshots to S3 Glacier:**
   - Glacier: $0.004/GB vs Standard $0.023/GB
   - Archive snapshots > 5 years old
   - **Savings: ~$3-5/month**

3. **Use BRIN indexes (already planned):**
   - Save $1.14/month vs B-tree indexes
   - Minimal query performance impact

4. **Partition by year:**
   - Improves query speed
   - Enable archiving old partitions
   - No additional cost

**General optimizations:**
- Stop EC2 when not in use (save ~$8/month)
- Stop SageMaker when not developing (save ~$30/month)
- Use Spot instances for training (save 70%)
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering for rarely accessed data (save 30-40%)

**Actual monthly cost with discipline:**
- **Base system:** $35-65/month
- **Temporal system:** $57-95/month
- **Peak (everything running):** $100/month

---

### Budget Status

**Target:** $150/month
**Current:** $38.33/month (74% under budget)
**With temporal:** $57-75/month (50-62% under budget)
**Peak usage:** $100/month (33% under budget)

**Temporal enhancement fits budget:** Adds $19-37/month, well within target.
