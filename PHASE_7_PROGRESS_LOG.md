   - `overnight_3_source_validation.sh`
3. **ADCE Autonomous System** (3 files)
   - `autonomous_loop.py`
   - `autonomous_cli.py`
   - `health_monitor.py`
4. **New Infrastructure**
   - `BaseWorkflow` abstract class
   - `Orchestrator` engine
   - `TaskQueue` with priorities
5. **Testing & Integration**

## 🎓 Lessons from Phase 6

### What Worked Well:
1. ✅ Starting with base classes (BaseAgent pattern)
2. ✅ Comprehensive testing before migration
3. ✅ Parallel coexistence strategy
4. ✅ Detailed progress tracking
5. ✅ Quality gates at each step

### Applying to Phase 7:
1. Start with `BaseWorkflow` (like `BaseAgent`)
2. Test thoroughly before migrating
3. Keep old scripts working alongside new
4. Track progress meticulously
5. Maintain 100% test coverage

## 🚧 Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **ADCE 24/7 Operation** - Cannot disrupt autonomous loop
   - Mitigation: Parallel implementation, gradual migration
   
2. **Shell Script Dependencies** - Unknown system dependencies
   - Mitigation: Analyze scripts thoroughly, document all dependencies
   
3. **Workflow State Management** - Complex state transitions
   - Mitigation: Robust state machine, comprehensive testing

### Medium Risk:
1. Task queue integration with existing agents
2. Workflow dispatch coordination
3. Error handling in autonomous mode

---

## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions:
- Following Phase 6 pattern: base class → implementations → tests
- Maintaining backward compatibility with shell scripts
- Using template method pattern for workflows
- Implementing state machine for workflow lifecycle

### Questions to Answer:
1. Are shell scripts currently scheduled in cron?
2. Is ADCE loop currently running?
3. What dependencies do workflows have?
4. Should workflows support async execution?

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes):
1. Read `data_dispatcher.py` to understand pattern
2. Design `BaseWorkflow` API
3. Start implementing base class

### Today (Day 1):
1. Complete `BaseWorkflow` implementation
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Achieve 100% coverage
4. Update package exports

### Tomorrow (Day 2):
1. Migrate workflow dispatcher
2. Implement orchestrator
3. Add task queue management

---

## 📞 Questions for Review

1. Should workflows support async/await patterns?
2. How should workflow state be persisted?
3. Should we use a database for task queue or in-memory?
4. What's the priority system for task queue?
