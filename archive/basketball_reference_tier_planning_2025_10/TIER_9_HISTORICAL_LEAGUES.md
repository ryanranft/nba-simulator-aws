## Data Quality Checks

### For Each Data Type:

1. **Record Count Validation**
   - ABA: 9 seasons × ~100 players per season = ~900 player-seasons
   - BAA: 3 seasons × ~100 players per season = ~300 player-seasons
   - Early NBA: 4 seasons × ~100 players per season = ~400 player-seasons

2. **Coverage Verification**
   - All 9 ABA seasons present (1967-1976)
   - All 3 BAA seasons present (1946-1949)
   - Early NBA seasons (1949-1952) present
   - Key players present (Dr. J, George Mikan, etc.)

3. **Data Structure Validation**
   - ABA stats include 3-point shooting (from 1967)
   - BAA/early NBA lack blocks/steals (not tracked)
   - Scoring totals consistent with era (lower in BAA/early NBA)

4. **Cross-Validation**
   - ABA merger teams (Nets, Nuggets, Pacers, Spurs) transition to NBA in 1976
   - BAA champions counted in NBA championship history
   - Player careers span ABA → NBA (Dr. J, Moses Malone)

## Historical Context

### ABA Innovations:
1. **3-Point Line** (1967, NBA adopted 1979)
2. **Red-White-Blue Ball** (iconic ABA basketball)
3. **Slam Dunk Contest** (1976 ABA All-Star)
4. **Above-the-Rim Play** (Dr. J, David Thompson)

### ABA-NBA Merger (1976):
- 4 ABA teams joined NBA (Nets, Nuggets, Pacers, Spurs)
- 2 teams folded (Kentucky Colonels, Spirits of St. Louis)
- ABA players entered NBA (Dr. J, Moses Malone, George Gervin, etc.)
- Merger settlement (Spirits owners received share of NBA TV revenue in perpetuity)

### Key ABA Players:
- **Julius Erving (Dr. J):** 5 ABA seasons, 2 ABA MVPs, ABA champion
- **Moses Malone:** 2 ABA seasons (age 19-20), then NBA HOF career
- **George Gervin:** 4 ABA seasons, then 10× NBA All-Star
- **Artis Gilmore:** 5 ABA seasons, ABA MVP, then long NBA career

### BAA → NBA Transition (1949):
- BAA merged with NBL (National Basketball League)
- Unified league became "NBA"
- BAA history counted as NBA history (championships, records)
- Minneapolis Lakers (George Mikan) dominated early NBA

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **ABA statistics may be incomplete**
   - Solution: Some ABA records lost or incomplete
   - Document known gaps

2. **BAA data very limited (pre-modern stat tracking)**
   - Solution: Capture what's available
   - No blocks, steals, turnovers tracked

3. **Early NBA pre-shot clock data skewed (low scoring)**
   - Solution: Document era context
   - Note game style differences

4. **ABA team relocations/name changes**
   - Solution: Maintain team history mapping
   - Many ABA teams folded or relocated frequently

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Load data to RDS PostgreSQL
2. Create unified player career tables (ABA + NBA combined)
3. Analyze ABA → NBA career transitions
4. Document complete basketball history (BAA → NBA → present)
5. Begin Tier 10 (WNBA Complete Collection)
