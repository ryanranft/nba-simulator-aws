# Command Execution Log (Example Template)

**Purpose:** This is an example template showing how to use the command logging system. Your actual COMMAND_LOG.md will contain real command outputs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY REMINDER

**Before committing COMMAND_LOG.md to Git:**
- Review for exposed credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens
- Sanitize AWS account IDs if sharing publicly
- Replace sensitive IPs/endpoints with placeholders (e.g., `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`)
- Remove or redact any Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- Check for database passwords or connection strings

## How to Use This Log

**Automated Logging (Recommended):**
```bash
# Source the logging function
source scripts/shell/log_command.sh

# Use log_cmd to automatically execute and log
log_cmd git status
log_cmd aws s3 ls s3://nba-sim-raw-data-lake/

# Add notes to the last logged command
log_note This command shows the current branch

# Add solution to the last logged command (for errors)
log_solution Used git remote set-url to fix the issue
```

## Tips for Using the Command Log

1. **Start each work session** by logging `git status` and `conda list` to document environment state
2. **Log failed commands immediately** - they're the most valuable learning data
3. **Add "Solution" field** after you resolve an error - helps future debugging
4. **Reference PROGRESS.md sections** to connect commands with project phases
5. **Use categories** consistently to make searching easier
6. **Review before committing** - check for secrets/credentials every time
7. **Add context in Notes** - explain why you ran the command, not just what it does

---

## Available Helper Functions

```bash
# Execute and log a command
log_cmd <command>

# Add a note to the last logged command
log_note <your note text>

# Add a solution to the last logged command
log_solution <solution description>
```

**This is an example file. Your actual COMMAND_LOG.md will be created when you start using `log_cmd`.**
